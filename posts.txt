{"type": "post", "subreddit": "SaaS", "title": "Stop making stupid SaaS and start solving real niche problems", "content": "It's always SaaS Groundhog Day on this community...\n\nAnother post, another AI copywriting tool that requires a PhD to figure out. Or, I am being invited to the 12th Product Hunt clone that’s gone live this month.\n\nYou all are fighting for scraps in oversaturated markets while actual businesses with money are BEGGING for solutions to real problems.\n\nThe gold mine isn't in your generic tracker app, nobody will pay for. It's in those unsexy niches where companies are desperate enough to throw cash at anyone who understands their actual pain points.\n\nStop chasing the SaaS hype train and start solving problems people actually have. Your bank account will thank you.\n\nHere are ten ideas for niche SaaS products that one of you should start building today.\n\n# Regulated Industries\n\n* Idea: HIPAA-compliant messaging platform for small medical clinics.\n* Why it's smart: Healthcare providers require secure communication tools that comply with strict regulations. Offering a HIPAA-compliant messaging solution addresses this critical need, ensuring patient data privacy and facilitating efficient communication within clinics.\n\n# Niche B2B Vertical Tools\n\n* Idea: Scheduling and management software tailored for pet groomers.\n* Why it's smart: Generic scheduling tools often lack features specific to pet grooming businesses. A specialized platform can offer functionalities like pet profiles, vaccination tracking, and breed-specific grooming notes, directly catering to the unique needs of this niche market.\n\n# Internal Tools for Non-Tech Teams\n\n* Idea: Onboarding portals designed for HR departments.\n* Why it's smart: Human Resources teams frequently rely on outdated systems or spreadsheets for onboarding. A dedicated portal streamlines the process, ensuring consistency, compliance, and a better experience for new hires.\n\n# Data & Reporting Automation\n\n* Idea: Automated reporting tools that sync e-commerce analytics to spreadsheets.\n* Why it's smart: Manually compiling reports from platforms like Shopify is time-consuming and error-prone. Automating this process saves time, reduces mistakes, and provides real-time insights for better decision-making.\n\n# Boring Business Back-Office\n\n* Idea: Small chain store documentation management system.\n* Why it's smart: Small chain stores deal with extensive documentation, from training manuals to compliance forms. A centralized system ensures consistency across locations and simplifies updates, which is crucial for maintaining brand standards.\n\n# Event-Specific Tools\n\n* Idea: Management software for niche events like science fairs or hackathons.\n* Why it's smart: Such events have unique requirements, including participant registration, project submissions, and judging criteria. A tailored tool addresses these specific needs, enhancing the experience for organizers and participants.\n\n# Low-Code / No-Code Enablers\n\n* Idea: A workflow automation platform for specific industries, like legal or real estate.\n* Why it's smart: Professionals in these fields often lack technical expertise but need customized solutions. A low-code platform empowers them to build and modify workflows without coding, increasing efficiency and adaptability.\n\n# SaaS for Creators (Beyond Content Tools)\n\n* Idea: Income tracking and financial management tool for digital creators.\n* Why it's smart: Digital creators often juggle multiple income streams, making financial tracking complex. A dedicated tool simplifies income management, tax preparation, and financial planning, allowing artists to focus on their creative work.\n\n# Operations Software for Physical Businesses\n\n* Idea: Route planning and scheduling software for neighborhood service providers like pool cleaners.\n* Why it's smart: Mobile service businesses need efficient route planning to save time and fuel. A specialized tool optimizes schedules and routes, enhancing productivity and customer satisfaction.\n\n# APIs for Niche Data or Services\n\n* Idea: A sentiment analysis of local political campaigns, enabling real-time tracking of voter sentiment within specific districts or municipalities.\n* Why it works: Local campaigns often lack the resources for extensive polling or data analysis. This tool provides affordable, real-time insights into voter opinions by analyzing social media, local news, and community forums.\n\nNow, anyone who got this far, I know what you’re going to say. So I wrote an FAQ to address all the questions that the trolls will post in response.\n\n# FAQ\n\n# What if there are already competitors in the niche?\n\nGreat! Competitors validate market demand. Most niches aren't winner-take-all. Focus on specific pain points they're neglecting or target an underserved segment. Being second in a proven market often beats being first in an unproven one.\n\n# I tried XYZ idea before and it failed\n\nYes, new businesses do fail all the time. This isn't a surprise. But if you focus on a clear and obvious problem for a niche audience, you have a much better shot at success than building a SaaS tool with no obvious market. And be sure to validate your idea at each step.\n\n# I don't know anything about this industry. How can I build for it?\n\nInterview 5-10 potential customers. Join industry forums and attend trade shows. Consider partnering with someone who has domain expertise. The knowledge barrier actually protects you from generic competitors who won't put in the work.\n\n# How do I price a niche SaaS product?\n\nDon't underprice. Niche products often command premium rates because they solve specialized problems. Research what businesses currently spend on alternatives, then price based on value delivered, not just your costs. Many B2B niche products can justify $100 to $500+ monthly.\n\n# How do I find these niche opportunities?\n\nLook for industries still using spreadsheets or outdated software. Talk to friends in non-tech fields. Browse industry forums for recurring complaints. The best niches are hiding in plain sight, just invisible to founders fixated with posting on this community.\n\n# Won't these markets be too small?\n\nA focused $3M business serving a specific niche beats a failed unicorn attempt. Many niches are larger than they appear and can support multiple successful companies. Starting narrow doesn't mean staying narrow. You can always expand after establishing your foundation.\n\n# How do I market to these niche audiences?\n\nForget growth hacking. Go where your audience already gathers, like industry conferences, trade publications, and specialized communities. One industry influencer or respected customer case study often opens more doors than thousands spent on generic marketing.", "top_comments": "none for now", "url": "https://redd.it/1kja4zu"}

Game Info / Steampage\n\n*(skip to next point if not interested)*\n\n**Name:** Fantasy World Manager\n\n**Developer:** Florian Alushaj Games\n\n**Publisher:**  Florian Alushaj Games\n\n**Steampage:** [**https://store.steampowered.com/app/3447280?utm\\_source=postmortem1**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3447280?utm_source=postmortem1)\n\n**Discord:**  [https://discord.gg/vHCZQ3EJJ8](https://discord.gg/vHCZQ3EJJ8)\n\n**Current Wishlists:** 4,781\n\n# 2. Pre-Launch Actions\n\ni frequently got asked what i did on my Page Launch Day to bundle alot of traffic Day 1, here is what i did:\n\n**a) Discord Communities**\n\ni got Discord Premium, this allows me to join ALOT more Discord Servers in general. I have joined over 30 Gamedev related Discords that allow advertising. I have posted atleast weekly on each one of them since i started the project, which was in December 2024.\n\nYou should not underestimate the power of those Discord Communities. While it ultimately might not convert many wishlists or mostly \"poor\" ones which might never convert, you get to meet other devs that like what you do, that already have experience or that have similar games like you to partner up or help each other.\n\ni have met alot of people that work for small indie studios that have released several games on steam, they gave me alot of tips for my first game, the most frequent ones:\n\n* Do proper Market Research\n   * its really important to check similar games and how games in your genre perform (median)\n   * find out what games you could combine, what you could do better - you dont have to reinvent the wheel.\n   * dont try make the 9988th vampire survivors, dont make the 9988th stardew valley, those are exceptions and not the norm. instead learn from them, what is the hook?\n* **Connect with other Devs**\n   * as already stated, other devs can be really valueable contacts and i definitely can call some of my dev contacts friends at this point, your friends are very biased no matter what you show them but your dev friends will be very honest if you ask for feedback\n* **KEEP ASKING FOR FEEDBACK**\n   * dont stop asking for feedback where-ever you can! you may have fun with your project, playing it yourself, but you are biased! showcase new stuff, no matter if its just your first Draft - people on reddit and discord are really good at giving feedback for improvements.\n* **Do not quit your job**\n   * Dont..dont...dont!\n   * expect your first game to be a \"failure\" in terms of revenue\n   * use your first game as your deep dive in all aspects of gamedev (including promotion &  (paid) marketing\n* **LOCALIZATION**\n   * this is so important, please localize your steampage!!! you will see why later.\n\n**b) Reddit**\n\n**I have made around 30 posts between December and 6th April (Steam Page Launch)**\n\n**they gained 1.3 Million Views and 14.000 Upvotes, over 1.000 shares. My Creator Page got 70+ Followers, my Reddit Account got 60+ Followers.**\n\n50% of those posts were not selfpromotion, they were progress updates in the r/godot community (check my profile) but alot of people saw my game and kept it in mind, because i posted frequently, and people kept pushing my posts!\n\n**c) thats it...**\n\nyou may have expected way more, but thats everything i did pre-steam-page-launch. However, my Reddit posts were a sign that my game does really well on Reddit. - thats important for post-launch activities i did.\n\n# 3. Launch Day\n\n**Those are the things i did on Launch Day:**\n\na) i posted on ALL Discord Communites i am part of that i launched my Steampage and asked for support! If i sum the reactions i got up in all those communitys, i got over 200 Reactions, i didnt UTM track those unfortunately but it definitely had an Traffic Impact.\n\nb) i made reddit posts in some subreddits, those posts gained  around 120k views combined, 300 shares.also here i didnt know that utm tracklinks existed but from the steam stats i could tell alot of traffic was from reddit.\n\n**Tose are the the things that happened without me doing anything on Launch Day:**\n\na) 4gamer article + twitter post:\n\nthe japanese magacine 4gamer posted my game, they just picked it up organically - if it was not localized in japanese, they would never have found my steam page. Thanks to their article i gained 700 wishlists from japan in the first 24 hours.\n\nthis combined with my own effort made me around 1,100 wishlists in the first day.\n\n# 4.) What happened since then?\n\nI made another Reddit post in gamedev,indiedev,worldbuilding some days after, which made me another 700 wishlists. Then i started getting quiet, i didnt post anymore for almost a Month. My Organic wishlists were 100 for a few day, it went down to 30-40.  Without me doing anything i was gaining those daily wishlists.. which was and still is really crazy.\n\n# 5.) Paid Reddit Ads\n\nAfter i reached 2.100 wishlists (17th april) i was certain that my game is really being liked on reddit, it was time to take the advice from fellow devs i met and try out reddit ads and hell yeah, it was the best decision. Since 17th April i have been running ads, i have made atleast 1600 wishlists with a spent budget of 400€ , those are the UTM tracked wishlists, which is an investment of 0,26€ per wishlist.\n\nMy Ads are still running, and i will keep them running until the demo releases. If you advertise in the right Subreddits, you will find your audience! Those are not \"poor\" wishlists as many people rant about. Many Contacts told me publishers usually do a big bugdet reddit ad campaign until your game has 7k wishlists and then they stop.\n\nSo why not do the same strategy?\n\n**My tips:**\n\n**1. Go for Conversion in your AD Campaign**\n\n**2. it does not matter if you use Carousel,Video,Image, i prefer Carousel**\n\n**3. Only include countries you localize for**\n\n**4. US should be in its own campaign, set your CPC to 0.30 , it will perform well enough**\n\n**5. Leave your Comments on, reply to people. i ahve really good experience with that (60+ comments on my ads)**\n\n**6. Also bring in people to your discord, i crossed 100 people today, its really cool to have people that love your game,it boosts motivation so high and you got playtesters!**\n\n# 6. NUMBER SICKNESS! CAREFUL!\n\nThis is really crazy, but if your game performs well with numbers.. stop looking at your numbers.. dont do it! I did that and i did only that for atleast a week, doing nothing for the game - just starring at those raising numbers and when one day it dropped a bit, i felt some panic!  I felt like the game is gonna fail while still performing better tan 90% of indie projects (firsts).\n\ni am only checking numbers weekly since that happened to me.\n\nwell..thats it.. i hope it was interesting. feel free to ask more questions!", "top_comments": "none for now", "url": "https://redd.it/1ki3odn"}

Phone glued to my hand. YouTube playing in the background 24/7. Brain so fried I couldn’t read a full paragraph without checking Reddit. I felt like my attention span was cooked.\n\nSo I spent 30 days resetting my brain — not with cheesy self-help books, but actual stuff that worked. Here’s what helped me go from brain-fried to actually disciplined again:\n\nPhase 1: Dopamine detox (the real kind)\n\t•\tPhone went grayscale. Insta and TikTok became boring overnight.\n\t•\tNo social media before 12PM. Morning brain is sacred now.\n\t•\tBlocked Reddit + YouTube during work hours. Cold-turkey. It hurt, but it worked.\n\t•\tMade a “dopamine menu” — stuff that gives long-term joy: workouts, walking outside, journaling. When I get the itch to scroll, I pick one from the list.\n\nPhase 2: Mental bootcamp\n\t•\tWoke up and made my bed immediately — it’s dumb but it flips a switch.\n\t•\tCold showers every morning. Instant reset button.\n\t•\t10-minute “mind dump” journaling every night. Stops the 2AM overthinking spiral.\n\t•\tPracticed just sitting in silence for 5 minutes. No music. No phone. No stimulus. Surprisingly hard — and that’s why it works.\n\nPhase 3: Discipline by design\n\t•\tCreated a “shutdown” ritual at night — lights off, screens off, book out. Brain starts winding down automatically now.\n\t•\tBroke my work into 90-minute blocks with real breaks. Way more sustainable than grinding nonstop.\n\t•\tTook the pressure off being “perfect.” Missed a day? Whatever. Show up tomorrow.\n\t•\tSet 1 non-negotiable task per day. Do that, day’s a win. Bonus tasks = extra points.\n\nSmall habits that had big results:\n\t•\tChew gum while working (weirdly helps me focus).\n\t•\tSwitched coffee to matcha + L-theanine. No more jittery crashes.\n\t•\tSet up a time-locking box for my phone. Game changer.\n\t•\tBox breathing (4-4-4-4). Sounds cheesy. Works.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nI didn’t “hack” my brain. I just stopped poisoning it 24/7 and gave it space to work. If you’re stuck, don’t overcomplicate it. Just start.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "gamedev", "title": "The Story of How Our Game Made Almost $500K Gross in 1 Month After a Year of Development", "content": "This is going to be a long and detailed post—so buckle up if you're into that kind of thing! Otherwise, here’s a TL;DR (that’s still kinda long).\n\nWhile writing this, I realized just how much info there is to share, so I edited it down. If other devs are interested, I’d be happy to follow up with more detailed posts—especially about our ad strategy during Next Fest or anything else you'd like to dive deeper into.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nWe released a successful game after 1 year of development, as a studio that's been together for 5 years. Despite a great launch, we made a number of mistakes that led to fair criticism in reviews. We’re actively working on improvements through updates, but here’s the overall timeline of we got here:\n\n* **Feb 2024**: Secured funding\n* **Mar 2024**: Selected *Do No Harm* as our primary project\n* **June 2024**: Showcased early version at Baku Game Summit, got feedback from Rami Ismail, redesigned core loop\n* **Late Sep 2024**: Steam page goes live, \\~1500 wishlists in 1 week (\\~500 on Day 1)\n* **Jan 29, 2025**: Trailer launches, \\~14,400 total wishlists right before that\n* **Feb 24 (Next Fest)**: \\~50K wishlists right before (Jan 29–Feb 23 avg: 1431/day, peak: 3712)\n* **Next Fest**: Top #50 demo, median playtime: 52 minutes\n* **Mar 6 (Launch)**: 105K wishlists\n* **Launch Metrics**:\n   * Day 1: \\~7.5K units / \\~$82K gross\n   * Week 1: \\~26K units / \\~$280K gross\n   * Month 1: \\~44K units / \\~$480K gross\n* **Next steps**: Major update in 3–6 weeks to address community feedback, and maybe console port in a few months.\n\n# Why I'm Sharing This\n\nThis post isn’t to advertise (gamedevs aren’t really our target audience) or to brag. I was inspired by other transparent devs like Alex Blintsov (*Furnish Master*), who openly shared his data with the community. While I won’t go quite as deep, I want to talk about what worked, what didn’t, and what we learned along the way while making [*Do No Harm*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/). Also, this is not exactly Post-Mortem (I wasn't sure what other tag to choose), as I don't consider our game dead yet - we are planning to continue working on it for a while. But maybe in a year or so, I'll do a full post-mortem focusing specifically on our mistakes.\n\n# Background\n\nWe founded our studio in 2019 with six devs, all with some experience in games. Our first project was overly ambitious, and by 2021 it had to be put on hold due to scope creep and lack of experience. We turned to outsourcing to stay afloat, while occasionally experimenting with smaller internal projects.\n\nAfter almost 3 years of outsourcing and through a round of raising funds from an angel investor, we finally secured enough funding to commit to internal development full-time for one year. To reduce risk, we split our efforts into three separate projects—each with a 4-month dev cycle. *Do No Harm* was one of them.\n\n# How We Chose the Game\n\nWith our team now at 13 people, everyone pitched their own game ideas. We voted internally and shortlisted three concepts. Then, the senior team picked the most viable one based on two key factors:\n\n* **Market demand**: Using tools like SteamDB, SteamTrends, and Gamalytics to analyze competition and genre viability.\n* **Feasibility**: We imposed hard scope limitations—e.g., the entire game had to take place in a single environment.\n\nThat left us with two finalists:\n\n* A *Papers, Please*\\-style spooky doctor sim\n* An *FTL*\\-like steampunk mecha game\n\nWhile the *FTL*\\-like seemed safer, we believed the doctor game had more potential if executed right. Our lead designer who came up with the idea in the first place, Omar Israfilov, was especially passionate about the idea, and we decided to go all in.\n\n# Early Development\n\nThe original prototype looked and especially played very differently from the current game. We aimed for a 2D/3D blend, inspired by *The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack*—juxtaposing smooth character art with grotesque close-ups. Our art team (who had previously done AAA outsourcing) worked hard to achieve this style, though technical and time constraints forced some compromises. Here is [Evolution of Art post](https://imgur.com/a/G4Q8HgC) (it's missing some stages that I will add later on).\n\nBy June 2024, at the Baku Game Summit, the game was focused on deduction using the symptoms the patients would give you, and combing through the Book of Medicine for treatment methods. The biggest difference from the current version was that you’d always find the correct answer in the book if you looked carefully enough while now you have to take some risks and work with imperfect information. The Lovecraftian elements were also barely there.\n\nPlayers at the event showed interest, but also clear sign of boredom. Our initial plan was to just add more features or raise the difficulty curve, but then we met Rami Ismail, who gave us some amazing advice: instead of pure logic puzzles, shift the game mechanics to taking calculated risks and making informed guesses.\n\nThis became the core loop: \"fuzzy\" decisions over rigid deduction. Humor and tension emerged from the uncertainty. His advice helped us make the core loop more about making educated guesses and taking informed risks with your treatment methods instead of simply solving the disease by combing through the Book of Medicine. This change we made resulted in Humor Circle and a much more interesting playthrough. It made the game more engaging—but it also meant we had to rebuild key systems. Eventually, we committed fully to *Do No Harm* and dropped/delayed the other two projects.\n\n# On Publishers and the Steam Page\n\nNow, one of the pieces of advice we also got was to not publish a Steam Page on our own, but rather contact publishers first and see if we can get any of them interested. Our main goal with contacting publishers wasn’t to get funding, but rather to find someone who would multiply our marketing efforts. That said, we did believe that the game was a potential mini-hit so we were looking for someone to cover our costs especially now that we decided to take the risk of only making one project in a year putting all of our funds into it. \n\nWe reached out to 50 publishers over 4 months. None met our minimum terms. Most only responded after we hit 6K+ wishlists and landed on the “Popular Upcoming” list. I'm going to make a separate post about our experience with publishers and my thoughts on the whole process.\n\nIn hindsight, waiting for a publishers was a mistake. Unless you're an established name or have an amazing or highly addicitve near-finished vertical slice, publishers will likely pass. Meanwhile, a live Steam page can help generate community interest and improve your bargaining power. It let us refine tags, get early feedback, and most importantly build our Discord.\n\nThe Playtest feature was especially helpful. We even used playtesters' responses to help set the price at $15.99 using a basic pricing survey formula (happy to share more about that if anyone's curious).\n\n# Marketing and Next Fest\n\nSeeing no success from getting publishers even after I presented in front of a great panel at the [Playcon event](https://playcon.gg/2024-event/indie-initiative/) that I was invited to in Malta - I understood that if we want the game to succeed we need to do more. After realizing we’d likely self-publish (outside China, where we partnered with Hawthorn Games), we focused on visibility. We secured a [trailer slot on GameTrailers](https://youtu.be/RCyjUzA9V08)—and surprisingly, it blew up. That traction helped us get picked up by IGN’s main YouTube channel too.\n\nWishlists went from \\~100/day to \\~1500/day almost overnight.\n\nWe launched a separate demo page on Feb 4 with two goals:\n\n1. Get more eyes on the game and thus feedback. Fix core issues before Next Fest\n2. Use Steam’s Demo Release Email to notify 40K wishlisters about the demo 1 week before the NextFest\n\nHaving the demo early paid off. It generated word of mouth and allowed us to polish based on the incoming reviews. Next Fest then took the demo results to the next level. We cracked the top 50 demos with a median playtime of 52 minutes despite having only 7 days worth of content (each day being 6 minutes long).\n\nThe NextFest itself was incredibly exciting and nerve-wracking for us. Especially because we knew that almost immediately after the Fest we’d have to release the game. The decision to release that soon instead of continue to polish was based on two things:\n\n1. We kind of had to. Our funds were running out, and we only had 1-2 more months of burn-rate in us.\n2. We wanted to use the peak of the hype for our game, as well as get some benefit from the Spring Sales via our Launch Discount.\n\nWe tried reaching out to media for another outreach attempt with our Release trailer on March 6th, but due to how delayed its production was, and given how focused we were on fixing all of the issues of the game, we only managed to finish the trailer by March 3rd. That was too late, and I think it was a marketing beat opportunity we lost.\n\n# Launch\n\nThe final pre-launch thing we did was bundling up with Death & Taxes (for an additional 20% discount). We reached out to more games, but unfortunately didn’t get to bundle in time. With hype at its peak and funds running low, we released on March 6, just 1 hour after finishing the final build (definitely don’t recommend doing that!). We launched with a 10% launch discount. Despite all of the flaws of the game, the response blew us away:\n\n* **105K wishlists at launch**\n* **Day 1:** 7.5K units / \\~$82K gross\n* **Week 1:** 26K units / \\~$280K gross\n* **Month 1:** 44K units / \\~$480K gross\n\nLooking at our reviews it becomes clear that we didn’t manage to implement the philosophy of fuzzy choices as well as we wanted to, and most importantly we didn’t communicate the way it works well. We also have issues with balancing and overall pacing of the game - but given that Do No Harm is our first big release, I still consider what we have done a huge success - especially if we continue to improve upon what we have. \n\nBeyond the numbers, the community has been incredible. The money we have earned has made us very happy, and secure in our future plans, but to be honest the support of our community on Discord, the fan arts, as well as all the YouTube and Twitch streams even from influencer we never reached out to is the main reason we got into gamedev and stuck with it despite 4-5 years of failing to release a game leading to this point. The feeling of seeing so many other people play and enjoy your game (even if they do rightfully complain about certain parts) is incredible.\n\n# What’s Next\n\nWe’re working on a Major update to address feedback (especially around balancing, pacing, and communicating the core game loop better). We have also added a few of the most active community members as characters into the game. \n\nBut beyond the game I’m also giving back to the team that has worked on the game. The whole team got a short paid vacation to spend time with family after the exhausting development we were through. I’ve also increased the wages of everyone on the team, as well as given a bonus based on the net income of the company, in addition to the shares of the company. I believe that in my team we aren’t making games for the studio or investors, but for ourselves (team members) and the general community. I want everyone on the team to be able to say proudly that they’ve made a game, rather than just worked on a title. Now we also have a dedicated community, and I hope that we’ll be able to keep them engaged and interested with our future games.\n\nLonger term our focus is to:\n\n* Fix internal production and documentation pipelines\n* Start work on a new game (while continuing to support *Do No Harm*)\n* Explore console and mobile ports for Do No Harm\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is our first real release after 4–5 years of trying and failing. It’s far from perfect—but it’s a massive step forward for our studio. If you’re in a similar position, I hope our story gives you a realistic, but hopeful perspective.\n\nFeel free to ask questions—I'll try to answer as best I can (might be a bit slow though as it’s nighttime for me).", "top_comments": "none for now", "url": "https://redd.it/1jt2dn3"}

(Full Guide on Self-Discipline)", "content": "Hey good day, I’m someone who used to be chronically lazy, fat and couldn’t focus on anything for more than 10 minutes 2 years ago. Now I lost 10 kg, do 3 hours of deep work in the morning, follow a 12 hour daily schedule and no longer have trouble fighting laziness.\n\nI’m here to share what helped from my journey of laziness to disciplined. I hope you take away something useful in this post.\n\nBuckle in. This post is long. Grab a notebook and pen you can use to take down notes.\n\n**This post to those who are struggling and can’t seem to fix their laziness. You probably struggled for a lot of time already. I now and I’ve been there. If you’re reading this, make this is your break through.**\n\n**(TLDR can be found at the bottom of the post. Though I highly recommend reading the whole article to understand the connection and how they each part interacts with each other.**\n\nAnd I’d like to start with:\n\nThe only way out is to stay consistent. Even if you waste days, weeks, or months if you keep putting in the work you'll gradually build that discipline you wanted.\n\nWe are humans and our energy is limited. This means if you’re goal is to never procrastinate again that mindset is wrong. Your goal should be to lessen your entertainment consumption using the 2 E’S.\n\nE 1 is for EDUCATION:\n\n* The amount of time you use to make your value to the world higher. Meaning your skills, abilities and capabilities. Because the better you are at something the more likely you are to keep doing it.\n\nE 2 is for ENTERTAINMENT:\n\n* This goes to the amount of time you waste. While I do not recommend wasting time, we are humans and we make mistakes. When you mess up forgive yourself. I mess up plenty of times too.\n\nWhy do you need to know all of this?\n\n# DOPAMINE.\n\nThe reason we want to do something is to experience feelings. The chemicals in your body that fire’s you up when you’re excited and makes you sad when someone says hurtful things to you.\n\nThis is what motivates and moves us. We as humans are driven by dopamine. Andrew Huberman said it best. *“Dopamine is war. It’s drive and motivation”.*\n\nNo matter what we do is driven by dopamine.\n\nLike what you do?\n\n* → Increases Dopamine.\n\nHate what you do?\n\n* → Lowers dopamine\n\nWhen I didn’t know any of this. I always wondered why I was wasting time. I was awake till 12am and still out there scrolling in social media and watching highly edited videos.\n\nEven though I was filling my mind with dopamine I was still having trouble knowing what to do.\n\n# Fixing laziness through dopamine.\n\nIf you’re someone who stays in bed, naps all day and can’t seem to do anything productively that’s because your brain is fried. Everything you do is boring so why do it at all? I know because I was like that too.\n\nWhen dopamine is over the top and it’s too much. Your body won’t move or want to do anything unless the stimuli in your brain is higher. And good habits have very low stimuli in our brains but bad habits spike them to the top.\n\nThe way to fix this is simple.\n\n* Schedule what time you want to waste and laze around. This sounds counter productive but if you look at your screen time. It’s probably over 10 hours if you aren’t lying. So if you schedule 3 hours of time wasting, this means you’ve just gained 7 hours of time. I had mine for over 12 hours and I decided to waste 4 hours. I got back 8 hours of time.\n* Journal what you do throughout the day and minimize all activities that causes a big spike in dopamine. Meaning your bad habits need to be regulated. I made progress when I become aware I was spending over 12 hours on my phone daily.\n* Make your education time than entertainment higher. For example you do 2 hours of entertainment, then you have to put up with doing 2hours and 10 minutes of education. Though this might be too much if you’re new. I highly suggest doing at least 10 minutes of education if you can’t overdrive your entertainment. Don’t let the ego get in the way too.\n\n# Habit formation. How to do it right.\n\nThe key to habit building is making it easy. Do not rely on motivation. It’s a friend that comes when you don’t want to and goes away when you need it the most. Use will power instead. But not the will power like “David Goggin’s” ultra discipline type. I found this the most useful.\n\nHere’s the process:\n\n1. Make it stupidly easy - If you are new to the gym you wouldn’t bench press 100kg. You would start with the empty barbell. The same principle goes to building habits. You make it stupidly easy it’s impossible to fail. This means instead of doing meditation for 1 hour you do 1 minute. This sounds cringe but it works. Back then I couldn’t even be productive for 30 minutes. So I decided to stick to doing 1 thing everyday for 10 minutes. I made the requirement so small that I could do it even in bad days.\n2. Don’t do it twice when you mess up - You have to stay consistent on the thing you’ve set on. You must not over do it when you skipped yesterday. This causes problems and makes you intimidated to start instead. Don’t do 2 hours of studying because you missed yesterdays 1 hour of studying session. It doesn’t work. I always felt more intimidated of doing the work instead of motivated.\n3. Stay consistent - Do not quit if you’ve been having trouble of had problems. If you got off for a week get back to it as soon as possible. You must never quit forever. You can take breaks but never forever. The key is to get back on track as soon as possible. That way you can stick and actually make results later. I was on and off my good habits. I would skip days and sometimes weeks. Just get back to it as soon as possible.\n\n# Sleep. How it helps you overcome laziness.\n\nSleep is the best legal performance enhancing drug. So if you only sleep around 4-5 hours like I did obviously you won’t feel productive and energetic.\n\nSince energy plays a vital role in becoming disciplined.\n\n* More energy = Higher chances of being productive.\n* Less energy = Higher chances of being lazy.\n\nI remember when I would sleep at 12 am the next day I would feel sluggish and tired. I would always scroll first thing in the morning and waste at least 2 hours watching in YouTube.\n\nBut now I don’t and I fixed it. I slept early, got more energy and actually became disciplined. I even have sometimes too much energy throughout the day that I get shocked at how much I get done.\n\nTo fix your sleep I recommend 3 things. This is how I also did it.\n\n1. Tire your body - The reason you are not able to sleep fast at night is because your body isn’t tired. This means your body is not seeking rest or recovery. And when it isn’t, it doesn’t want to sleep. It wants to use that energy and get tired. So tire your body during the morning and you’ll have an easier time to sleep. I decided to clean our house more than required. Enough to make me tired at nighttime.\n2. Schedule - You need to sleep daily and consistently everyday. This way your body clock gets regulated and fixed. You’ll have to put up not being able to sleep properly for a few days but once you get this rolling it becomes easier. I found this easy to follow once you practice it over a week.\n3. No phone 1 hour before bed - Blue light causes our eyes to go dry and makes our mind stay awake. This means you need to stay away from screens near your bedtime. That way you’ll have an easier time to sleep and stay on track. I always notice the difference when I would scroll before sleeping. My eyes would dry out and cause my brain to stay alert. But if I don’t I can feel my eyes being sleepy helping me sleep faster.\n\n# Don’t trust motivation. Use will power instead.\n\nMotivation cannot be trusted. It’s like a toxic friend that comes when you don’t want to and comes away when you need it. Instead of relying on watching motivational videos and indulging in mindless consumption. I highly recommend just accepting the suck.\n\n**The suck is doing the hard work you don’t want to do. It’s painful and uncomfortable but you do it. And that’s how you build will power. I made progress when I accepted I have to put in the work even if I don’t want to. But the problem is most people do it too hard. They do 1 hour of meditation or 1 hour of exercise and you’ll end up not doing it since it’s too hard. Been there too.**\n\nHere’s what to do instead:\n\n* Choose 1 thing you don’t want to do. E.g. working out or waking up early or doing house chores.\n* Do the bare minimum. Don’t do 1 hour of meditation. Do 1 minute instead.\n* Schedule when you are going to do it. Early in the morning? Afternoon? Evening?\n* Be specific about it. What time? 6am? 7am? 12nn? 8pm?\n\nI was down bad back in the days. Focusing for even 10 minutes was close to impossible. So I decided to lower the bar so low it made it impossible for me to fail.\n\nOver time you should add more habits. The good ones.\n\n# Good habits.\n\nThere are a lot of good habits I can talk about but I will only tackle 3. Which were the most helpful in my discipline journey.\n\n* Tracker journal - Everyday before sleeping I wrote down what I did. This made me more inspired and motivated to work harder.\n* Working out- The more I built my muscles the more confident I got. This made me more inclined to keep doing my good habits.\n* Reading- I didn’t start reading physical books. Those were too intimidating. I started reading digitally in my phone using some app that summarizes book learnings. It would only take me 5 minutes a day which made it easier to do.\n\nThis habits came about after 2 months after I’ve built some foundation.\n\nThis 3 habits built my foundation of discipline. Yours will be different but with similar habits. You don’t have to follow mine but it’s a good start if you don’t know what to do.\n\n**I also highly recommend reading the summary to really internalize all of this information.**\n\nTLDR (Summary) :\n\n* Education should overdrive entertainment. Since if you don’t you fry your dopamine reward system. Aim to at least make your education time higher than entertainment everyday. If you can’t keep trying.\n* Dopamine controls what we do. We are prone to do pleasurable activities such as doom scrolling because it’s considered fun by the brain. Lower your dopamine baseline by gradually eliminating bad habits. To ensure the habits you do are pleasurable and fun. The lower your dopamine the better and easier it is for you to do hard work while having fun.\n* Your habits dictate your future. Build the right habits by 1) Making it stupidly easy 2) Don’t do twice if you skipped a day 3) Forgive yourself when you mess up.\n* Fix your sleep and your productivity skyrockets. Sleep is the best performance enhancing drug. The more energy you get from sleep the better your chances of doing hard things. To sleep better 1) Tire your body during the day with physical activities 2) Schedule bed time 3) No phone in 1 hour before bed.\n* Don’t trust motivation and use will power. Motivation is unreliable. Will power on the other hand will make you mentally stronger and makes it easier for you do to hard work. Lower the bar so low it’s impossible to fail. e.g. 1 minute of meditation over 1 hour.\n* Good habits are good for consistency. Read, workout and track your daily activities. This makes you more motivated and healthy overall.\n\nI hoped you liked this summary. If this is hard to understand I highly recommend reading the whole post.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "getdisciplined", "title": "5 brutal truths i learned after trying digital detox", "content": "A year ago, my screen time was around 13 hours per day. I wasn’t just scrolling - I was living online. I’d check TikTok first thing in the morning, doomscroll through lunch, and somehow find myself on Reddit at 3 am reading about 17th-century shipwrecks. My attention span? Gone. My motivation? Nonexistent. One day i got a flip phone and tried to log off for weeks at a time. At first, I nearly lost my mind. But after two days, I started reading again, actually talking to my family, and remembering what it was like to exist outside the algorithm. If you’re stuck in the infinite scroll, these books will break your brain (in a good way). Here are the 5 things I learnt from those readings, along with thoughtful summaries of the chapters that resonated with me most:\n\n**\\- Your focus is stolen - here’s how to get it back**\n\n[**Stolen Focus**](https://befreed.ai/book/stolen-focus-by-johann-hari/heart) **by Johann Hari** explains why our attention spans are fried. Spoiler: it’s not just you, it’s the entire system. This book made me realize I wasn’t “lazy” - I was just overstimulated. Here’s a quote from the summary of the most impactful chapter about how the big techs hijacked our focus: \"The business model driving this system is what Shoshana Zuboff calls \"surveillance capitalism\"-the extraction of behavioral data to predict and influence future behavior. Under this model, users aren't customers; they're the product being sold to advertisers. The more precisely platforms can target ads, the more they can charge, creating relentless pressure to gather ever more intimate data and hold attention ever more effectively.\nThis system doesn't just waste our time-it reshapes our information environment in profound ways. Algorithms optimize for engagement, not truth or social value, leading to the amplification of emotionally triggering content, particularly content that provokes outrage. Research shows that moral and emotional language spreads farther and faster online, especially negative emotions like anger. This creates a media ecosystem that systematically promotes division and extremism.\"\n\n\n**\\- You don’t need more willpower, you need a new system**\n\n[**Indistractable**](https://befreed.ai/book/indistractable-by-nir-eyal/heart) **by Nir Eyal** (behavioral design expert, legit researcher) isn’t some “just put your phone down” advice. It teaches how to train your brain to resist distractions. The best part? It’s practical AF. No fluff, just straight-up methods that work. Below is a key quote from the summary that really hit me hard and encouraged me to make changes:\n\"To overcome these internal triggers, you need to believe in yourself. The way you speak to yourself is crucial. If you tell yourself you're lazy or incapable, you'll likely act that way. Instead, use positive self-talk, just as you would encourage a friend. Adopt rituals like mantras, routines, and positive behaviors to reinforce a positive self-image.\"\n\n**\\- your brain wasn’t built for infinite scrolling**\n\n[**The Shallows**](https://befreed.ai/book/the-shallows-by-nicholas-carr/heart) **by Nicholas Carr** breaks down how the internet rewires our brains for short-term dopamine hits. Ever felt like you used to be able to read long books but now struggle with a single article? Yeah, this book explains why and how to fix it.\n\n**\\- boredom is a superpower**\n\n[**Digital Minimalism**](https://befreed.ai/book/digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport) **by Cal Newport** argues that we need to relearn boredom to regain focus. At first, I thought this sounded stupid - but when I actually tried it, my brain felt so much better. Letting yourself be bored is the key to creativity and deep thinking.\n\n**\\- You’re not as in control as you think**\n\n**Hooked by Nir Eyal** (same guy as Indistractable) exposes how apps are designed to get you addicted. Reading this felt like seeing the Matrix. After finishing it, I deleted half the apps on my phone because I finally understood exactly how they were manipulating me. Insane read.\n\nIf social media has hijacked your life, here’s my advice: take a break. Not just for a few hours, but for weeks. Use a flip phone, go offline, let your brain detox. It’ll suck at first, but trust me - after a few days, you’ll feel human again. And if you don’t know what to do with all that extra time? Read. It might just rewire your brain in the best way possible.", "top_comments": "none for now", "url": "https://redd.it/1j7zizx"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "getdisciplined", "title": "Studying with ADHD: A Reality-Based Guide", "content": "As someone with ADHD, I've learned that effective studying isn't about forcing our brains to work like everyone else's. It's about working WITH our unique wiring, not against it. Here's what actually works:\n\nFirst of all, of course - Planning\n\nInstead of making elaborate study plans that you'll abandon by tomorrow (which i do most of the time), try this:\n\n\\- Plan only your next study session (2 hours max)\n\n\\- Break it into 25-minute chunks\n\n\\- Decide on ONE main thing to tackle\n\n\\- Have a backup task for when your brain inevitably rebels against the main task ( i do this almost 50% of the time)\n\n2. Environment tips \n\nYour study space needs to work with your ADHD brain:\n\n\\- Create different study \"stations\" to switch between (you can choose from \"rate my study space\" memes from this subreddit :D)\n\n\\- Keep fidget toys nearby (seriously, they help and no, I'm not 12)\n\n\\- Have snacks and water within reach\n\n\\- Use noise-canceling headphones or background noise that works for you (i have two small siblings so a lot of background noise) \n\n\\- Consider body doubling (studying with someone else present, even virtually)\n\n3. focus tips\n\nInstead of trying to force hours of continuous focus:\n\n\\- Use the \"stupid small\" approach: Start with just 5 minutes\n\n\\- Switch subjects when you feel your attention drifting (no one is perfect)\n\n\\- Mix active and passive learning methods\n\n\\- Take advantage of hyperfocus when it hits\n\n\\- Use timers to avoid time blindness + background music (no lyrics preferably)\n\n4. Making Information Stick\n\nour ADHD brains need more engagement:\n\n\\- Create mind maps instead of linear notes\n\n\\- Teach concepts to others (even if it's just explaining to your cat, or you can explain to the toy i mentioned before)\n\n\\- Use color and movement in your study materials\n\n\\- Connect new information to things you're already interested in\n\n\\- Record voice notes for later review (it's kinda cringe for me to hear my voice later on, but i listen it on bus usually)\n\n5. The Daily Reality Check / journaling (it's really hard to do it everyday, but it'd still work even once a week)\n\neach day do a quick reflection:\n\n\\- What actually worked today?\n\n\\- What made you lose focus?\n\n\\- What would make tomorrow easier?\n\n\\- When did you feel most engaged?\n\nThe uncomfortable truth you have to accept about ADHD:\n\n\\- Some days will be harder than others\n\n\\- What works this week might not work next week\n\n\\- You might need to explain your methods to professors or study partners\n\n\\- Traditional study groups might not be your thing\n\n\\- Your best studying might happen at \"weird\" times\n\nRemember:\n\n\\- Progress isn't linear\n\n\\- Adaptation beats rigid systems\n\n\\- Self-compassion is crucial\n\n\\- Your unique approach is valid\n\n\n\nAction Steps (Pick Just ONE):\n\n1. Try studying for 25 minutes with a timer\n\n2. Set up one study station with everything you need\n\n3. Record yourself explaining one concept\n\n4. Draw one mind map\n\n5. Find one study buddy for body doubling\n\n\n\nThe most important thing isn't following all these suggestions perfectly. It's about starting somewhere or    and building from there. Your ADHD brain is different, and that's okay. Work with it, NOT AGAINST it.\n\nStart with drinking that water. Then pick one tiny thing from this post. That's enough for now.\n\nP.S. Keep track of what works for YOU. Your perfect study system might look nothing like this post, and that's exactly how it should be.\n\nRight now, just write down ONE thing you want to understand better. That's it. Start there.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "getdisciplined", "title": "A Complete 3-Step Guide to Quit Any Addiction", "content": "I'm making this post to save you from wasting years of your life trying to quit, just like I did.  \n(I've posted this on other subreddits as well to help as many people as possible)\n\nBut first, let me give you a quick introduction- 2 and a half years ago, I decided to improve my life. With that I realized that I unfortunately had multiple addictions- **porn, phone addiction, junk food/sugar, video games, binging TV shows, etc.**\n\nNow, allow me to flex.\n\n* About 450 days ago, I watched porn for the last time in my life.\n* At the start of this year, my screen time went officially from 8 hours to 30 minutes.\n* I also decided to go sugar-free (added sugars) 8 months ago to test myself (and I'm still successful)\n\nAnd finally, I can confidently say that I have understood everything necessary to break free from bad habits/addictions. I barely even get any cravings anymore. Keep in mind it wasn't always like this- I went through the same struggles you face and made mistakes on my journey.\n\nI hope this helps as much as it would've helped me a couple of years ago, but anyways here's EVERYTHING I learnt after successfully breaking free from my addictions:\n\n**1- Gradual decrease > Cold turkey**\n\nA while after I quit my porn addiction, I came across a video of a guy explaining that completely quitting all at once isn't going to work. It made sense. I started to reflect back and realized that with every streak I held, the amount of days I abstained kept increasing and increasing, up until I could stop for 30 days comfortably, at which point I quit for good.\n\nSo basically, I unknowingly used a gradual decrease, and it worked.\n\nIt makes sense- your brain wouldn't be used to having absolutely no dopamine spikes after being used to experiencing dopamine rushes for the past couple of years of your life.\n\nThen, I implemented this principle to quit my phone addiction and junk food.\n\nI do think I could have quit a lot quicker if I maintained a written plan and tracked my indulgences rather than having a rough idea. It might sound weird to 'schedule' your next relapse but instead think of it as achieving small goals of abstaining, that in the long run, will lead to you becoming free. I think a gradual decrease over a couple of months will work.\n\n**2- PURPOSE**\n\nPeople think that discipline is the most important thing when it comes to quitting, but it isn't. I realized that there was a technique that was much more effective than resisting cravings.\n\nAnd that is- getting rid of the craving in the first place.\n\nYes, it is possible to eliminate, or at least drastically reduce, the amount of urges you get.  \nHow do I know this? Because I've done it myself. I can't say for sure that I NEVER get cravings, but finding purpose in life has 100% worked for me.\n\nThink about why you want to live your life (hard question- I know haha) and be as ambitious as possible. For example, I want to become a successful entrepreneur who can change the lives of many people while becoming financially free.\n\nNow, you might think doing this is irrelevant, but please stick with me on this one.  \nHere's the thing; I was trying to quit my addictions, but I didn't know WHY I was trying.\n\nYour brain will not give up your addictions unless it realizes that there is are benefits that make it worth quitting. \"He who has a why can bare for almost any how\".  \nSo- think about your dreams in life, and ask yourself how quitting will benefit you.\n\nThis shifts the focus from you STRUGGLING to quit, to now BENEFITING from abstaining.  \nThis also boosts your discipline like crazy since it's a lot easier to view things logically.\n\nAlso, you will end up falling back into addiction if you have no clue what you are going to spend your time on. I replaced the time and energy by mainly pursuing entrepreneurship, along with other things like sports, working out, reading, sleeping more, so on and so forth.\n\nI suggest having one key passion to devote most of your time to, and then doing other healthy or enjoyable things on the side.\n\n**3- CUES AND RESPONSE**\n\nThis is by far the easiest part of the journey.  \nThe habit loop consists of 4 parts: Cue -> Craving -> Response -> Reward  \n(Craving is sometimes omitted since it's closely linked to reward, but yeah)\n\nPurpose handles craving and reward, but now let's focus on what TRIGGERS you to start the ROUTINE of the habit.\n\nIn order to eliminate cues, which is once again stupidly simple, you need to CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT. For example, I simply put my phone in a drawer instead of on the table, and boom- my triggers for my phone addiction fell by roughly 50%. All because my phone was out of sight.\n\nDon't believe me? What if I told you that 95% of American soldiers addicted to heroin during the Vietnam War were able to easily quit as soon as they came back home?\n\nSo- think about your cues- and find a way to remove them from your life. Be strict with this. Don't come up with excuses.\n\nAnd finally, to reduce your response to bad habits, INCREASE FRICTION. This is basically adding more steps to complete before indulging in your addiction. The idea behind this is that when your brain realizes that effort is needed to do something, it puts it off and procrastinates. And yes- this applies to the things we want to quit as well.\n\nAs soon as I read about this from Atomic Habits- I implemented it and understood that the human brain is pretty simple. And silly.\n\nSo just make your bad habit harder to do. For example, I kept the controller to my gaming console in another room, and deleted the apps on my phone. The added effort and time needed to indulge now made my brain crave these things less. TRY THIS FOR YOURSELF, PLEASE.\n\nAlright, I spent about half an hour writing everything above, and I really do hope it helps.\n\nMy DMs are open if you need anything else. TAKE ACTION, and all the best ahead :)", "top_comments": "none for now", "url": "https://redd.it/1itghje"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "passive_income", "title": "I Paid $300 for This Etsy POD Method and I'm Giving It Away for Free!", "content": "Hey everyone, I invested $300 in an Etsy Print-on-Demand (POD) method, and honestly, I feel like it's information that should be accessible to everyone. So, I'm sharing the core strategy with you all for free! This is an evergreen niche that you can jump into almost immediately with very little to no investment.  With some effort, you could realistically make $500/month profit to start, and from there, the sky's the limit!\n\nGetting Started:\n\nYou'll need an Etsy shop, which costs $15 to set up.  However, you can get 40 free listings through a referral. I won't post mine directly out of integrity, but it's easy to find. Just search \"40 free listings\" on Etsy and click on a random shop.  Look in their shop description for their referral link.\nMake Printful or Prentify account and link it to Etsy.\nWhile this method focuses on Etsy, you can also apply it to other POD platforms like Redbubble, Teespring, Teepublic, Zazzle, and more.\nThe Method:\n\nThis strategy revolves around leveraging the popularity of celebrities, artists, musicians, actors, etc.\nChoose a Celebrity: \nPick someone with a dedicated fanbase.\n Find a Quote:\nSelect a memorable quote, song lyric, or phrase that resonates with their audience. \n Create a Design:  This is where the magic happens! Let's say Taylor Swift has a line \"Karma is a cat.\" You could design an image of a woman holding a cat that embodies the concept of Karma.\n\nAI Design Magic:\n Use Ideogram (Free): Go to Ideogram and use a prompt like:  \"Please make me a vector graphic design that perfectly resembles this quote (insert your quote here) that also resonates with the audience and interacts with them.\"\n\nRefine in Canva Pro: Copy the design from Ideogram and go to Canva Pro (In a previous post, I mentioned I could help others get Canva Pro lifetime access for cheap price, thanks to everyone who trusted me– DM me for info). Upscale the design, remove background with BG remover, download your images as PNG, make any necessary adjustments, and polish it.\n\nListing and Marketing:\nCreate Multiple Designs: Aim for at least 10 designs like this daily to build a solid catalog.\nMockups are Key: Use Canva Pro's mockup tools to create professional-looking product mockups. This will make your listings stand out.\n\nUpload to Etsy: \nUpload your designs with relevant tags and titles. Take full advantage of your 40 free listings.\nStay free and unlimited!: you also can sell your designs to Etsy as SVGs, I used this before and sometimes it was more profitable than POD, don't limit yourself to one thing.\nStay Consistent:  Consistency is crucial.  The more designs you have, the better your chances of success.\nImportant Considerations:\n Avoid Naming the Artist Directly: Don't mention the celebrity's name in your titles or descriptions. You can use their name in your tags.\n\nCopyright: Double-check that the quote you're using isn't copyrighted. If it's in the public domain, including the quote as text in your designs can boost conversions.\n\nPatience: \n Don't expect overnight success.  Give your shop time to grow and your designs time to gain traction.\nThis method is very profitable and everyone can jump into it.\n It requires some effort, but the low startup cost and the potential returns make it a worthwhile venture.

There's nothing better in life than teaching someone how to fish (or showing them that fishing is a skill they can easily learn!)\n\nTo be frank, there's so much bulllshit online - and soo many of you are complete posers who aren't serious about making money.\n\nYou 'want' to make money (who the fuck doesn't?), but you never take any fucking action. \n\nI want to talk about practical ways to make money NOW.\n\nNot some long ass gameplan..\n\nRIGHT. THE FUCK. NOW!\n\nThis is definitely more geared towards people just getting started.. (As this is how I started my entrepreneurial journey)\n\nPersonally I believe IF YOU'RE SERIOUS - YOU CAN START MAKING MONEY TODAY! (Otherwise you may be bs-ing yourself and being an entrepreneur isn't for you :/ )\n\nI know what I'm talking about. I've sold hundreds of thousands of items online over the past 10 years.. \n\nMy path has taken me into a specific niche (anyone here like LEGO?), so I don't do this anymore on this level.. But I still have such a sweet spot for the simple art of buying and selling misc things - and I believe this is the key to getting started!\n\nHere are some ways I've made money buying and selling over the years..\n\n(And no, I don't want anything from you - I just hope this maybe helps someone get started TODAY!)\n\n'BUY LOW SELL HIGH'\n\nThere are millions of items out there that you can make money on..\n\nEverything has a value.\n\nI have bought many things for less than a dollar that I have resold for hundreds..\n\nFirst of all you gotta know how to find what things sell for online..\n\n'HOW DO I FIND ITEMS VALUES?'\n\nSearch 'sold' items on Ebay - and this will show you how much the thing is worth.\n\nDo not look at the current items for sale as their true value. Instead look to see what they have sold for in the past! (Many people will overprice their items so you need to see that it has actually sold)\n\n'WHERE DO I FIND THINGS TO SELL?'\n\n+ Thrift stores\n\nCheck your local thrift stores a few times a week - take out your damn phone, and pull up the Ebay app.\n\nIf you pick it up, look it up!... seriously! Just Ebay search everything!\n\nMaybe even hundreds of things!\n\nThe most random crap sells for a lot online.\n\nTeacups? Look them up! \n\nOld board games? Look em up!\n\nAction figures? Books? Shoes? Search search search!!\n\nUsually you will want to pay less than $5 and resell for at least $25.\n\nI always liked to talk to the employees and tell them what I was doing - \n\nOver the years I made friends with them and they helped me know what new items have shown up in their shop that could be good to resell!\n\n+ Yard sales (Oh god I love yard sales!!)\n\nHave a game plan the day before you go out - research and know where you'll be driving. This way you know where to go before you hit the road.\n\nFind community yard sales so you can hit up a bunch at once..\n\nGet up early!\n\nMy secret to yard sales: Walk up to the owner and ask them if they have whatever it is you're looking for! If you're super nice and polite and respectful, many times they will go into the house and bring it out for you!\n\nThis way you can be on the hunt! And you can check WAY more yard sales throughout the day by not wasting any time looking around! \n\n+ Craigslist \n\nBesides searching for items to resell, try writing a post where you are COMPLETELY OPEN WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING!\n\nPersonally I think this is a gamechanger.\n\nMake a post under the 'wanted' section - and have the title be something like 'WANTED: Anything, really'\n\nExplain that you sell items online, and you will be able to pay cash for anything that can be resold on Ebay. \n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of responses I've gotten for this! The coolest people respond and you will be flooded with options of things you can make money on.\n\nPeople respect the hell out of honesty - and they're cool with you making money, as long as you're real with them..\n\n+ Ebay\n\nYou don't have to leave the house for this one!\n\nMake an advanced search for whatever you're looking for - with 'Buy it Now' and 'Newly listed' as the search options..\n\nThis will show you the newest items that have been put up for sale - and if you search enough times a day you will eventually find something severely under priced that you can make money on!\n\n+ Ebay to Amazon\n\nMost people want it NOW! So they ignore Ebay and go straight to Amazon.\n\nBecause of this, most items sell for way more on Amazon compared to Ebay!\n\nYou can list items for sale on Amazon now, and once they sell - head over to Ebay and purchase the item and have it shipped to the buyer. Everybody's happy and you keep the difference!\n\n*Note: because you never actually see the product in person, you have to be careful with this one. If the buyer complains you will most likely have to send their money back 100% and take the losa.\n\n+ Alibaba.com\n\nMost likely you've heard of this site. It connects wholesalers from around the world to buyers who want stuff to resell.\n\nEvery fucking thing imaginable is for sale here, with wholesale prices.\n\nThis is definitely more advanced, but WAY EASIER THAN YOU MAY THINK!! \n\nJust a random example of something you can buy and resell - I found wholesale conveyor belts at $500 each. Here in the US they go for $1800! (There's shipping coats and fees, but the profits are still excellent!)\n\nIt takes time to contact them, ask for samples, and wait for delivery (conveyors for example took 1.5 months to arrive) - but there is BIG money here. I've heard people say 70% of items on Amazon were sourced through Alibaba!\n\nThere are definitely many more ways to get started in the world of being your own boss, but I just love the simplicity of buying and selling. You can start that TODAY!\n\nI hope this maybe helps somebody out there get started! \n\nPlease please please let me know if you have any questions!\n\n I don't want anything from you  - I just want to be a help! I wish someone would have told me these things years ago when I was first getting started..\n\nLife can be so damn exciting, you just need to see that it's all possible - you need to prove it to yourself.. and you can do that by starting to make money today!\n\nAnyway that's about it..\n\nHave a wonderful mother fucking day y'all!!\n", "top_comments": "none for now", "url": "https://redd.it/92onia"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "u_madhuforcontent", "title": "Reality of Making Money Online [Avoid Losing Money]", "content": "**Note:** I created this post after noticing many concerns and discussions in related subreddits, aiming to help people gain a better understanding.\n\n[Starting an online business](https://www.reddit.com/user/madhuforcontent/comments/1h5h6wq/online_business_models_mmo/) or making money online is an exciting journey, but it's important to understand the reality behind it, so you get better prepared with expectations and lead the rest of the journey confidently.\n\n**Let's get in.**\n\n1. Earning money online is challenging (never easy) and requires years of consistent effort to achieve significant rewards.\n2. Avoid falling for get-rich-quick schemes. Earning real money online requires genuine effort and hard work. No short cut at all.\n3. Success in making money online depends on mastering the art of driving quality traffic. Achieving this requires years of effort, experimentation, and discovering the right traffic sources that work for you.\n4. Don’t fall for claims of push-button money-making systems; real success online requires effort and strategy.\n5. Entering the world of online business or making money online without a solid understanding of digital marketing or basic marketing principles is unlikely to lead to success.\n6. In the \"make money online\" space, more than 40-50% of YouTube videos are unreliable. They’re often created to capture attention and drive engagement rather than provide genuine value. True trade secrets are rarely shared for free.\n7. Paid ad traffic is costly and requires years of expertise to use effectively, while organic traffic takes time to build. Success demands patience, consistent effort, and a commitment to long-term strategies.\n8. Building a personal brand has become essential for achieving long-term success in making money online.\n9. The bigger the problem you solve, the greater your earning potential.\n10. Affiliate marketing is a [legitimate way to make money](https://olspsystem.com/join/1016224/a1) (affiliate link), but many people fail because they lack consistency, patience, effort, and a clear strategy to execute. It’s not a get-rich-quick method.\n11. To succeed in making money online, you need hard work, patience, consistent effort, and a commitment to continuous learning. There are no shortcuts to achieving long-term rewards.\n12. Some techniques demonstrated in some YouTube videos claiming quick money should be carefully verified; otherwise, you risk losing your account on that platform.\n13. Unless people trust you, they won’t be willing to do business with you.\n14. Provide value first, and only then ask for business.\n15. Earning from social media isn’t easy unless you have a strong, engaged following or have built relationships with potential customers.\n16. Building email lists is a must. Never ignore this.\n17. Spamming with links (in DMs) won’t help you in any way to earn.\n18. Remember, there is no such thing as free money. No action, no money.\n\n**P.S:** You can bookmark, share, or save this post, as I will update it in the future to provide you with the best insights for navigating online success.\n\n**In conclusion**, building a successful online business or making money online is a marathon, not a sprint. Focus on providing value, solving real problems, building relationships, developing content creation skills, and investing time into upgrading marketing skills.\n\nIn other words, stay patient, consistent, and committed to continuous improvement to reap overall good rewards online.", "top_comments": "none for now", "url": "https://redd.it/1hxaqud"}
{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Entrepreneur", "title": "I will absolutely be rich one day. ", "content": "I'm a 23 year old college student that works full time while attending classes. I've worked at a storage facility for around a year. Before I worked here, I thought that I'd go to school, get my degree, and work a 9-5 making 100-160k a year and be happy. Working here has completely changed my outlook on life.\n\nOften times I get average customer (or assholes), but sometimes I meet people that are super inspiring and interesting. I've gotten personalized advice and exchanged contact information with CEO's of energy companies, automobile manufacturers, trucking companies, house flippers, oil company sales directors, etc. The types of people that make over 500k a year. I've been offered a business broker job.\n\nI've realized that these people are normally happy to chat and share advice, such as how they started, around how much they make a year, problems they've encountered, recommendations for me. They normally say finish school and use the income to start something of my own. Maybe they see themselves in me.\n\nThere is no way that I will work a 9-5 for the rest of my life. I understand the security and comfort that people get from it, but I want greater in life. I'm absolutely materialistic, but I don't think it's a nasty word as some people use it. I like nice things. Within the last year of working here, ive began reselling. I've been pretty profitable on FBA, Ebay, Facebook Marketplace. But I need to scale up, I need something more official and consistent.\n\nI want the freedom to say \"Fuck it, I think ill book a flight to Japan today\", and not have to worry about things like a boss telling me whether or not I can go or if I have enough money saved up. I hate the feeling of being sleepy in the morning, but having to drag myself out of bed to keep my 18.50/hr job (though it's a great job  as a student). Seeing my dad work a job that was harsh on his body for over 20 years, just to recently start making $150k/yr has inspired me to be better.\n\nI started this semester classes yesterday, and my engineering graphics teacher was saying \"You guys want this degree so you can get a good job, work for a good company, and after 30 to 40 years, retire\". It scared me a bit. That sounded terrible! Making another person richer and richer. Fuck that. Humans live for around 77 years on average, and I need to make the most of it. I've already wasted years of my life dicking around for 4 years after highschool at a shitty job. I'm just glad this revelation has occurred to me now. \n\nI'll be finishing up my ME degree over the next few years, and in the mean time saving as much money as I can. I'm not super sure what I'll do exactly. I've been interested in house hacking, and could see myself buying a duplex while renting out the other half, and selling after a few years to reinvest in larger properties. I'll continue asking every customer that comes in for advice, and if they do any kinds of business or investments. I've learned not to judge a person by what they wear or drive. Some of the richest people I've met drove a basic ass car. People you could google.\n\nMaybe I'll start a company of some sorts, I have no idea. I've gotten advice in the meantime to open up an LLC and a business credit card and make super tiny transactions on it, so when I have my \"big-boy job\", ill have a larger credit line. I think I'll use this next year at this job to network with as many people as possible, maintain my high GPA, and continue developing skills during downtime, like programming.\n\nIf anybody has life / financial advice stories they'd be willing to share I'd appreciate it. My DM's are open. Seriously, I may be willing to send like 5 bucks or so to people that offer seriously good advice or experience.
