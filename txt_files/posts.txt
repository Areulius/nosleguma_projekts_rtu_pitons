92onia✺⭆Entrepreneur✺⭆IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING MONEY THEN HERE'S SOME WAYS TO START TODAY GOD DAMNIT✺⭆I understand this may come off as harsh, but this is coming from a place of deep love and respect - I KNOW how valuable your time really is and I so desperately want you to see this truth for yourself.\n\nYOU NEED SOME MOMENTUM - TO SEE THE DOLLARS COME IN AND CONFIRM THAT YOU CAN DO IT!\n\nIf this post helps one person TAKE ACTION, I will be so happy! There's nothing better in life than teaching someone how to fish (or showing them that fishing is a skill they can easily learn!)\n\nTo be frank, there's so much bulllshit online - and soo many of you are complete posers who aren't serious about making money.\n\nYou 'want' to make money (who the fuck doesn't?), but you never take any fucking action. \n\nI want to talk about practical ways to make money NOW.\n\nNot some long ass gameplan..\n\nRIGHT. THE FUCK. NOW!\n\nThis is definitely more geared towards people just getting started.. (As this is how I started my entrepreneurial journey)\n\nPersonally I believe IF YOU'RE SERIOUS - YOU CAN START MAKING MONEY TODAY! (Otherwise you may be bs-ing yourself and being an entrepreneur isn't for you :/ )\n\nI know what I'm talking about. I've sold hundreds of thousands of items online over the past 10 years.. \n\nMy path has taken me into a specific niche (anyone here like LEGO?), so I don't do this anymore on this level.. But I still have such a sweet spot for the simple art of buying and selling misc things - and I believe this is the key to getting started!\n\nHere are some ways I've made money buying and selling over the years..\n\n(And no, I don't want anything from you - I just hope this maybe helps someone get started TODAY!)\n\n'BUY LOW SELL HIGH'\n\nThere are millions of items out there that you can make money on..\n\nEverything has a value.\n\nI have bought many things for less than a dollar that I have resold for hundreds..\n\nFirst of all you gotta know how to find what things sell for online..\n\n'HOW DO I FIND ITEMS VALUES?'\n\nSearch 'sold' items on Ebay - and this will show you how much the thing is worth.\n\nDo not look at the current items for sale as their true value. Instead look to see what they have sold for in the past! (Many people will overprice their items so you need to see that it has actually sold)\n\n'WHERE DO I FIND THINGS TO SELL?'\n\n+ Thrift stores\n\nCheck your local thrift stores a few times a week - take out your damn phone, and pull up the Ebay app.\n\nIf you pick it up, look it up!... seriously! Just Ebay search everything!\n\nMaybe even hundreds of things!\n\nThe most random crap sells for a lot online.\n\nTeacups? Look them up! \n\nOld board games? Look em up!\n\nAction figures? Books? Shoes? Search search search!!\n\nUsually you will want to pay less than $5 and resell for at least $25.\n\nI always liked to talk to the employees and tell them what I was doing - \n\nOver the years I made friends with them and they helped me know what new items have shown up in their shop that could be good to resell!\n\n+ Yard sales (Oh god I love yard sales!!)\n\nHave a game plan the day before you go out - research and know where you'll be driving. This way you know where to go before you hit the road.\n\nFind community yard sales so you can hit up a bunch at once..\n\nGet up early!\n\nMy secret to yard sales: Walk up to the owner and ask them if they have whatever it is you're looking for! If you're super nice and polite and respectful, many times they will go into the house and bring it out for you!\n\nThis way you can be on the hunt! And you can check WAY more yard sales throughout the day by not wasting any time looking around! \n\n+ Craigslist \n\nBesides searching for items to resell, try writing a post where you are COMPLETELY OPEN WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING!\n\nPersonally I think this is a gamechanger.\n\nMake a post under the 'wanted' section - and have the title be something like 'WANTED: Anything, really'\n\nExplain that you sell items online, and you will be able to pay cash for anything that can be resold on Ebay. \n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of responses I've gotten for this! The coolest people respond and you will be flooded with options of things you can make money on.\n\nPeople respect the hell out of honesty - and they're cool with you making money, as long as you're real with them..\n\n+ Ebay\n\nYou don't have to leave the house for this one!\n\nMake an advanced search for whatever you're looking for - with 'Buy it Now' and 'Newly listed' as the search options..\n\nThis will show you the newest items that have been put up for sale - and if you search enough times a day you will eventually find something severely under priced that you can make money on!\n\n+ Ebay to Amazon\n\nMost people want it NOW! So they ignore Ebay and go straight to Amazon.\n\nBecause of this, most items sell for way more on Amazon compared to Ebay!\n\nYou can list items for sale on Amazon now, and once they sell - head over to Ebay and purchase the item and have it shipped to the buyer. Everybody's happy and you keep the difference!\n\n*Note: because you never actually see the product in person, you have to be careful with this one. If the buyer complains you will most likely have to send their money back 100% and take the losa.\n\n+ Alibaba.com\n\nMost likely you've heard of this site. It connects wholesalers from around the world to buyers who want stuff to resell.\n\nEvery fucking thing imaginable is for sale here, with wholesale prices.\n\nThis is definitely more advanced, but WAY EASIER THAN YOU MAY THINK!! \n\nJust a random example of something you can buy and resell - I found wholesale conveyor belts at $500 each. Here in the US they go for $1800! (There's shipping coats and fees, but the profits are still excellent!)\n\nIt takes time to contact them, ask for samples, and wait for delivery (conveyors for example took 1.5 months to arrive) - but there is BIG money here. I've heard people say 70% of items on Amazon were sourced through Alibaba!\n\nThere are definitely many more ways to get started in the world of being your own boss, but I just love the simplicity of buying and selling. You can start that TODAY!\n\nI hope this maybe helps somebody out there get started! \n\nPlease please please let me know if you have any questions!\n\n I don't want anything from you  - I just want to be a help! I wish someone would have told me these things years ago when I was first getting started..\n\nLife can be so damn exciting, you just need to see that it's all possible - you need to prove it to yourself.. and you can do that by starting to make money today!\n\nAnyway that's about it..\n\nHave a wonderful mother fucking day y'all!!\n✺⭆['I fully expected a link to buy your book at the bottom of this post tbh. ', 'Sup Gary V', 'I\'m happy you posted this - this is exactly how I started. I went homeless at age 20/21 and was basically not doing anything to get out of the situation. I was squatting in a college house of a girl I had met on Tinder. Went to a couple job interviews (dishwasher and salmon processing in Alaska) but never landed anything. My birthday came up and I got $100 from my dad. $75 immediately went back to my friends that I\'d borrowed from to keep myself fed and I had $25 left. I spent about 5 hours on a Saturday walking to 3 yard sales in the area. I bought a tennis racket for .50 and an unopened Cranium board game for $1. There was an NES Classic for only $50 but I didn\'t have the money for it. I wanted it so bad to sell. Anyway, sold the tennis racket to an Arab living in the house, he was so infatuated by the idea of a tennis racket on his wall. I sold it for $5. Sold Cranium on eBay for I think $15 plus shipping.  \n\n\nThat\'s where it started. I ended up turning this into a full on career for a bit. I didn\'t have a real job. My weekday routine was to go wait in the line for DI (the Goodwill of Utah) to open. There were about 10 regular flippers. One had a niché in books and had some kind of scanning device. A few had a niché in LEGOs (I later learned why - they remain extremely valuable even after being used). Some had a niché in name brand glasses and clothing. Me? Pretty much anything in the Yard or Collectibles. Board games were my shit though. I could always find shrinkwrapped board games and resell them for great money. I would get versions of Risk and Ticket to Ride for $1 each and they\'d sell for $40-$60. Pottery became a bit of a niché for me. Hull and McCoy are the best. If you can learn your pottery, you can edge out competition and make good money because many people don\'t know pottery and it\'s super collectible. Decent furniture would work for me if I could fit it in my car - I could usually flip good furniture same day on Facebook. Most notably, barstools in good condition. I once bought a tiny box of glass cartridges of some sort. It was .50 and I had no clue what it was but it was so cheap and I was curious, so I bought it. Turned out to be vacuum tubes for a Fender amp. they sold for about $60 I think.  \n\n\nAnyway, I ended up turning that into a consistent $1,900/month income, which wasn\'t great, but to only work 1-2 hours per day and enjoy the novelty of learning everything, it\'s been my favorite job to date (aside from what I do now). Now, I have utilized Alibaba to start my own Amazon store and am pulling about $3,500/wk in profit. Though, to be fair, my main income is from a product I invented and used Alibaba to find a manufacturer. Not a lot of it comes from buying and reselling existing products.  \n\n\nThis is great advice and you broke it down very well, including teaching people how to use the Completed Listings/"Sold" filter on eBay to find true price. There\'s a new Deseret Industries (thrift shop) opening right by my house and I\'m considering picking throughout the week just to entertain myself.']
1ihiphr✺⭆Meditation✺⭆Sam Harris said to Huberman "One graduates from breath attention to open awareness." I've been mediating for years - but only just heard this. I assumed they were different styles - not one being "higher level" than the other.✺⭆Anybody have thoughts on this at all? Tbh, I find Sam to be a bit too pretentious my tastes. I appreciate how he tries to get you to see things through a different lens in his guided meditations, but I always just found them a bit too much. I did TM for a little over a year, then switched to mindfulness (15 minutes of breath awareness in the morning and five min of open awareness in afternoon). ✺⭆['This is definitely Sam’s opinion. I like Sam generally but he states opinions as facts more often than I like. \n\nIn my opinion, one can traverse the entire path on breath awareness alone. My teacher, Shinzen Young, teaches at least 40 standard mindfulness techniques, yet says that you only “need” one. \nIt’s about what works for you. There are advantages and disadvantages to most techniques.', 'Going from hard and focused attention on the meditation object. To loosening that grip slowly, relaxing while maintaining the attention. To eventually including more awareness of other senses and surroundings.\n\nSeems like a logical progression to me. The stronger your concentration is the more things you can hold in your awareness while maintaining it.\n\nBut I don’t think that’s a stage the majority of people who’ve meditated ever get to.']

1iinqc6✺⭆passive_income✺⭆I Paid $300 for This Etsy POD Method and I'm Giving It Away for Free!✺⭆Hey everyone, I invested $300 in an Etsy Print-on-Demand (POD) method, and honestly, I feel like it's information that should be accessible to everyone. So, I'm sharing the core strategy with you all for free! This is an evergreen niche that you can jump into almost immediately with very little to no investment.  With some effort, you could realistically make $500/month profit to start, and from there, the sky's the limit!\n\nGetting Started:\n\nYou'll need an Etsy shop, which costs $15 to set up.  However, you can get 40 free listings through a referral. I won't post mine directly out of integrity, but it's easy to find. Just search "40 free listings" on Etsy and click on a random shop.  Look in their shop description for their referral link.\nMake Printful or Prentify account and link it to Etsy.\nWhile this method focuses on Etsy, you can also apply it to other POD platforms like Redbubble, Teespring, Teepublic, Zazzle, and more.\nThe Method:\n\nThis strategy revolves around leveraging the popularity of celebrities, artists, musicians, actors, etc.\nChoose a Celebrity: \nPick someone with a dedicated fanbase.\n Find a Quote:\nSelect a memorable quote, song lyric, or phrase that resonates with their audience. \n Create a Design:  This is where the magic happens! Let's say Taylor Swift has a line "Karma is a cat." You could design an image of a woman holding a cat that embodies the concept of Karma.\n\nAI Design Magic:\n Use Ideogram (Free): Go to Ideogram and use a prompt like:  "Please make me a vector graphic design that perfectly resembles this quote (insert your quote here) that also resonates with the audience and interacts with them."\n\nRefine in Canva Pro: Copy the design from Ideogram and go to Canva Pro (In a previous post, I mentioned I could help others get Canva Pro lifetime access for cheap price, thanks to everyone who trusted me– DM me for info). Upscale the design, remove background with BG remover, download your images as PNG, make any necessary adjustments, and polish it.\n\nListing and Marketing:\nCreate Multiple Designs: Aim for at least 10 designs like this daily to build a solid catalog.\nMockups are Key: Use Canva Pro's mockup tools to create professional-looking product mockups. This will make your listings stand out.\n\nUpload to Etsy: \nUpload your designs with relevant tags and titles. Take full advantage of your 40 free listings.\nStay free and unlimited!: you also can sell your designs to Etsy as SVGs, I used this before and sometimes it was more profitable than POD, don't limit yourself to one thing.\nStay Consistent:  Consistency is crucial.  The more designs you have, the better your chances of success.\nImportant Considerations:\n Avoid Naming the Artist Directly: Don't mention the celebrity's name in your titles or descriptions. You can use their name in your tags.\n\nCopyright: Double-check that the quote you're using isn't copyrighted. If it's in the public domain, including the quote as text in your designs can boost conversions.\n\nPatience: \n Don't expect overnight success.  Give your shop time to grow and your designs time to gain traction.\nThis method is very profitable and everyone can jump into it.\n It requires some effort, but the low startup cost and the potential returns make it a worthwhile venture.  I'm happy to answer any questions you have in the comments and I'll keep posting more helpful content.✺⭆['Check out the [Community Highlights](https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income) for current and future Mod Vetted opportunities and Newsletter Episodes.\n\n**No one will pay you a percentage of your crypto for simply "testing" or sending crypto to an address on any blockchain network.

1itghje✺⭆getdisciplined✺⭆A Complete 3-Step Guide to Quit Any Addiction✺⭆I'm making this post to save you from wasting years of your life trying to quit, just like I did.  \n(I've posted this on other subreddits as well to help as many people as possible)\n\nBut first, let me give you a quick introduction- 2 and a half years ago, I decided to improve my life. With that I realized that I unfortunately had multiple addictions- **porn, phone addiction, junk food/sugar, video games, binging TV shows, etc.**\n\nNow, allow me to flex.\n\n* About 450 days ago, I watched porn for the last time in my life.\n* At the start of this year, my screen time went officially from 8 hours to 30 minutes.\n* I also decided to go sugar-free (added sugars) 8 months ago to test myself (and I'm still successful)\n\nAnd finally, I can confidently say that I have understood everything necessary to break free from bad habits/addictions. I barely even get any cravings anymore. Keep in mind it wasn't always like this- I went through the same struggles you face and made mistakes on my journey.\n\nI hope this helps as much as it would've helped me a couple of years ago, but anyways here's EVERYTHING I learnt after successfully breaking free from my addictions:\n\n**1- Gradual decrease > Cold turkey**\n\nA while after I quit my porn addiction, I came across a video of a guy explaining that completely quitting all at once isn't going to work. It made sense. I started to reflect back and realized that with every streak I held, the amount of days I abstained kept increasing and increasing, up until I could stop for 30 days comfortably, at which point I quit for good.\n\nSo basically, I unknowingly used a gradual decrease, and it worked.\n\nIt makes sense- your brain wouldn't be used to having absolutely no dopamine spikes after being used to experiencing dopamine rushes for the past couple of years of your life.\n\nThen, I implemented this principle to quit my phone addiction and junk food.\n\nI do think I could have quit a lot quicker if I maintained a written plan and tracked my indulgences rather than having a rough idea. It might sound weird to 'schedule' your next relapse but instead think of it as achieving small goals of abstaining, that in the long run, will lead to you becoming free. I think a gradual decrease over a couple of months will work.\n\n**2- PURPOSE**\n\nPeople think that discipline is the most important thing when it comes to quitting, but it isn't. I realized that there was a technique that was much more effective than resisting cravings.\n\nAnd that is- getting rid of the craving in the first place.\n\nYes, it is possible to eliminate, or at least drastically reduce, the amount of urges you get.  \nHow do I know this? Because I've done it myself. I can't say for sure that I NEVER get cravings, but finding purpose in life has 100% worked for me.\n\nThink about why you want to live your life (hard question- I know haha) and be as ambitious as possible. For example, I want to become a successful entrepreneur who can change the lives of many people while becoming financially free.\n\nNow, you might think doing this is irrelevant, but please stick with me on this one.  \nHere's the thing; I was trying to quit my addictions, but I didn't know WHY I was trying.\n\nYour brain will not give up your addictions unless it realizes that there is are benefits that make it worth quitting. "He who has a why can bare for almost any how".  \nSo- think about your dreams in life, and ask yourself how quitting will benefit you.\n\nThis shifts the focus from you STRUGGLING to quit, to now BENEFITING from abstaining.  \nThis also boosts your discipline like crazy since it's a lot easier to view things logically.\n\nAlso, you will end up falling back into addiction if you have no clue what you are going to spend your time on. I replaced the time and energy by mainly pursuing entrepreneurship, along with other things like sports, working out, reading, sleeping more, so on and so forth.\n\nI suggest having one key passion to devote most of your time to, and then doing other healthy or enjoyable things on the side.\n\n**3- CUES AND RESPONSE**\n\nThis is by far the easiest part of the journey.  \nThe habit loop consists of 4 parts: Cue -> Craving -> Response -> Reward  \n(Craving is sometimes omitted since it's closely linked to reward, but yeah)\n\nPurpose handles craving and reward, but now let's focus on what TRIGGERS you to start the ROUTINE of the habit.\n\nIn order to eliminate cues, which is once again stupidly simple, you need to CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT. For example, I simply put my phone in a drawer instead of on the table, and boom- my triggers for my phone addiction fell by roughly 50%. All because my phone was out of sight.\n\nDon't believe me? What if I told you that 95% of American soldiers addicted to heroin during the Vietnam War were able to easily quit as soon as they came back home?\n\nSo- think about your cues- and find a way to remove them from your life. Be strict with this. Don't come up with excuses.\n\nAnd finally, to reduce your response to bad habits, INCREASE FRICTION. This is basically adding more steps to complete before indulging in your addiction. The idea behind this is that when your brain realizes that effort is needed to do something, it puts it off and procrastinates. And yes- this applies to the things we want to quit as well.\n\nAs soon as I read about this from Atomic Habits- I implemented it and understood that the human brain is pretty simple. And silly.\n\nSo just make your bad habit harder to do. For example, I kept the controller to my gaming console in another room, and deleted the apps on my phone. The added effort and time needed to indulge now made my brain crave these things less. TRY THIS FOR YOURSELF, PLEASE.\n\nAlright, I spent about half an hour writing everything above, and I really do hope it helps.\n\nMy DMs are open if you need anything else. TAKE ACTION, and all the best ahead :)✺⭆['TLDR\n\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to replace it with a good one.\n\n– Jerome Hines', 'Great job, OP! You should be proud of yourself. That said, it’s important to recognize the significant difference between heavier substances—such as crack, meth, heroin, opiates, and alcohol—and how intensely they hijack the dopaminergic reward system. Some of these can even be life-threatening if not detoxed properly.\n\nStay proud of your progress, but also remain humble. Overcoming addiction is a complex journey, and you may not know understand “everything” necessary to break free from addiction.']
1irwvm7✺⭆learnprogramming✺⭆Dear future coders/full stack devs/app makers, this is what I would've told the younger me.✺⭆I know your lazy but write comments on whatever you do and whatever you may need to make changes to later. Lost so much time relearning a code blocks. No one has perfect memory.\n\nUsing chat gpt to code is great but understand the code. go to documentation of what your using (ex celery, react) because the answers are most likely there. no its not scary.\n\nStuck on a bug for too long and feel like your going crazy? happens to everyone take a walk, ask out your crush, hug a stranger, anything to get your mind off of it.\n\nTry to avoid requesting data from your database don't use mysql too much caching is your friend. if you do only get/update whats needed \n\nCache everything and anything. caching can always become more efficent (example I cached 20000 stocks in 5 different arrays/caches then realized caching by their first letter is faster) this speeds up time and saves money. redis is my go to. \n\nAll code can be more efficent its an endless loop don't try to over do everything. you will lose time\n\nBackup all your data. Dont make mysql commands without knowing 100% what your doing. databases have been deleted before. cough cough gitlab deleted cough a database I backup to backblaze on the daily and home laptop/server\n\nGithub is a must a push is updating code in your github project and pull is retrieving changes from other people. This is a push: \n\ngit add . \n\ngit commit -m "Your commit message here" \n\ngit push origin main  \n\nFIRST TIME git push -u origin main\n\nthis is a pull:\n\ngit pull origin main and enter your user and pass\n\nDocker is great to seperate your database, daily backups, backend, frontend, tasks/celery, ext. Just a sh file that basicaly automates using terminal to install all necessary packages and commands you normaly typed to get your database/ backend working. \n\nMy backend sh for django installs python, copies my code, and packages I added \n\n    FROM python:3.10.10-slim\n    \n    ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED \n    1\n    WORKDIR \n    /backend\n    RUN \n    apt-get\n     \n    update\n     \n    &&\n     \\n        \n    apt-get\n     \n    install\n     \n    -y\n     \n    python3-dev\n     \n    default-libmysqlclient-dev\n     \n    redis-tools\n     \n    build-essential\n     \n    pkg-config\n    COPY \n    ./requirements.txt\n     \n    .\n    RUN \n    cat\n     \n    requirements.txt\n    RUN \n    pip\n     \n    install\n     \n    -r\n     \n    requirements.txt\n    COPY \n    .\n     \n    .\n\nServer are the most expensive so if your starting out use hetzner its the cheapest. next cheapest is digital ocean. If you want to burn all your money or big company use aws google cloud or any other big company. \n\nCloudflare is everywhere because they are the best. Use it for caching photos. Not videos because they dont allow unless you use their database. Use zero trust to protect your server. its just a docker container and cloudflare serves as a middle man. \n\nVideo and photo stoarage backblaze b2 is cheap. if you want to burn money or big company s3 is good\n\nRandom info but i use amex acount for business because its the only one that doesnt require money in the account. lol i have $1 and no fees no issues yay. Filed using northwest for an LLC and haven't had any issues\n\nSo far my database is mysql, frontend is quasar/vuejs, capacitor for ios, backend is django, celery and websockets for automating tasks(used with django), nginx, apis are financial modeling prep for stock data, postmark for emails( couldn't get into aws ses and its soooo cheap ugh)\n\nSome commands I use everyday:\n\npython3 [manage.py](http://manage.py) runserver for django dev server, python [manage.py](http://manage.py) shell to make changes to django backend, python3 [manage.py](http://manage.py) makemigrations change data/columns, python3 [manage.py](http://manage.py) migrate change data/column, quasar dev to start frontend, docker-compose up --build run/update containers , docker-compose exec container sh to get into container, quasar build -m capacitor -T ios to build ios app, npx cap open ios to open ios app\n\nAnyone else have anything to add? \n\n✺⭆["Don't push to master.

1itbabt✺⭆getdisciplined✺⭆Studying with ADHD: A Reality-Based Guide✺⭆As someone with ADHD, I've learned that effective studying isn't about forcing our brains to work like everyone else's. It's about working WITH our unique wiring, not against it. Here's what actually works:\n\nFirst of all, of course - Planning\n\nInstead of making elaborate study plans that you'll abandon by tomorrow (which i do most of the time), try this:\n\n\- Plan only your next study session (2 hours max)\n\n\- Break it into 25-minute chunks\n\n\- Decide on ONE main thing to tackle\n\n\- Have a backup task for when your brain inevitably rebels against the main task ( i do this almost 50% of the time)\n\n2. Environment tips \n\nYour study space needs to work with your ADHD brain:\n\n\- Create different study "stations" to switch between (you can choose from "rate my study space" memes from this subreddit :D)\n\n\- Keep fidget toys nearby (seriously, they help and no, I'm not 12)\n\n\- Have snacks and water within reach\n\n\- Use noise-canceling headphones or background noise that works for you (i have two small siblings so a lot of background noise) \n\n\- Consider body doubling (studying with someone else present, even virtually)\n\n3. focus tips\n\nInstead of trying to force hours of continuous focus:\n\n\- Use the "stupid small" approach: Start with just 5 minutes\n\n\- Switch subjects when you feel your attention drifting (no one is perfect)\n\n\- Mix active and passive learning methods\n\n\- Take advantage of hyperfocus when it hits\n\n\- Use timers to avoid time blindness + background music (no lyrics preferably)\n\n4. Making Information Stick\n\nour ADHD brains need more engagement:\n\n\- Create mind maps instead of linear notes\n\n\- Teach concepts to others (even if it's just explaining to your cat, or you can explain to the toy i mentioned before)\n\n\- Use color and movement in your study materials\n\n\- Connect new information to things you're already interested in\n\n\- Record voice notes for later review (it's kinda cringe for me to hear my voice later on, but i listen it on bus usually)\n\n5. The Daily Reality Check / journaling (it's really hard to do it everyday, but it'd still work even once a week)\n\neach day do a quick reflection:\n\n\- What actually worked today?\n\n\- What made you lose focus?\n\n\- What would make tomorrow easier?\n\n\- When did you feel most engaged?\n\nThe uncomfortable truth you have to accept about ADHD:\n\n\- Some days will be harder than others\n\n\- What works this week might not work next week\n\n\- You might need to explain your methods to professors or study partners\n\n\- Traditional study groups might not be your thing\n\n\- Your best studying might happen at "weird" times\n\nRemember:\n\n\- Progress isn't linear\n\n\- Adaptation beats rigid systems\n\n\- Self-compassion is crucial\n\n\- Your unique approach is valid\n\n\n\nAction Steps (Pick Just ONE):\n\n1. Try studying for 25 minutes with a timer\n\n2. Set up one study station with everything you need\n\n3. Record yourself explaining one concept\n\n4. Draw one mind map\n\n5. Find one study buddy for body doubling\n\n\n\nThe most important thing isn't following all these suggestions perfectly. It's about starting somewhere or    and building from there. Your ADHD brain is different, and that's okay. Work with it, NOT AGAINST it.\n\nStart with drinking that water. Then pick one tiny thing from this post. That's enough for now.\n\nP.S. Keep track of what works for YOU. Your perfect study system might look nothing like this post, and that's exactly how it should be.\n\nRight now, just write down ONE thing you want to understand better. That's it. Start there. Good luck <3✺⭆['Should have done this in 5 posts for adhd', 'I typed in a small amount of whatever I’m studying into chat GPT and tell it to be a game show host and then the material into questions.

1j7zizx✺⭆getdisciplined✺⭆5 brutal truths i learned after trying digital detox✺⭆A year ago, my screen time was around 13 hours per day. I wasn’t just scrolling - I was living online. I’d check TikTok first thing in the morning, doomscroll through lunch, and somehow find myself on Reddit at 3 am reading about 17th-century shipwrecks. My attention span? Gone. My motivation? Nonexistent. One day i got a flip phone and tried to log off for weeks at a time. At first, I nearly lost my mind. But after two days, I started reading again, actually talking to my family, and remembering what it was like to exist outside the algorithm. If you’re stuck in the infinite scroll, these books will break your brain (in a good way). Here are the 5 things I learnt from those readings, along with thoughtful summaries of the chapters that resonated with me most:\n\n**\- Your focus is stolen - here’s how to get it back**\n\n[**Stolen Focus**](https://befreed.ai/book/stolen-focus-by-johann-hari/heart) **by Johann Hari** explains why our attention spans are fried. Spoiler: it’s not just you, it’s the entire system. This book made me realize I wasn’t “lazy” - I was just overstimulated. Here’s a quote from the summary of the most impactful chapter about how the big techs hijacked our focus: "The business model driving this system is what Shoshana Zuboff calls "surveillance capitalism"-the extraction of behavioral data to predict and influence future behavior. Under this model, users aren't customers; they're the product being sold to advertisers. The more precisely platforms can target ads, the more they can charge, creating relentless pressure to gather ever more intimate data and hold attention ever more effectively.\nThis system doesn't just waste our time-it reshapes our information environment in profound ways. Algorithms optimize for engagement, not truth or social value, leading to the amplification of emotionally triggering content, particularly content that provokes outrage. Research shows that moral and emotional language spreads farther and faster online, especially negative emotions like anger. This creates a media ecosystem that systematically promotes division and extremism."\n\n\n**\- You don’t need more willpower, you need a new system**\n\n[**Indistractable**](https://befreed.ai/book/indistractable-by-nir-eyal/heart) **by Nir Eyal** (behavioral design expert, legit researcher) isn’t some “just put your phone down” advice. It teaches how to train your brain to resist distractions. The best part? It’s practical AF. No fluff, just straight-up methods that work. Below is a key quote from the summary that really hit me hard and encouraged me to make changes:\n"To overcome these internal triggers, you need to believe in yourself. The way you speak to yourself is crucial. If you tell yourself you're lazy or incapable, you'll likely act that way. Instead, use positive self-talk, just as you would encourage a friend. Adopt rituals like mantras, routines, and positive behaviors to reinforce a positive self-image."\n\n**\- your brain wasn’t built for infinite scrolling**\n\n[**The Shallows**](https://befreed.ai/book/the-shallows-by-nicholas-carr/heart) **by Nicholas Carr** breaks down how the internet rewires our brains for short-term dopamine hits. Ever felt like you used to be able to read long books but now struggle with a single article? Yeah, this book explains why and how to fix it.\n\n**\- boredom is a superpower**\n\n[**Digital Minimalism**](https://befreed.ai/book/digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport) **by Cal Newport** argues that we need to relearn boredom to regain focus. At first, I thought this sounded stupid - but when I actually tried it, my brain felt so much better. Letting yourself be bored is the key to creativity and deep thinking.\n\n**\- You’re not as in control as you think**\n\n**Hooked by Nir Eyal** (same guy as Indistractable) exposes how apps are designed to get you addicted. Reading this felt like seeing the Matrix. After finishing it, I deleted half the apps on my phone because I finally understood exactly how they were manipulating me. Insane read.\n\nIf social media has hijacked your life, here’s my advice: take a break. Not just for a few hours, but for weeks. Use a flip phone, go offline, let your brain detox. It’ll suck at first, but trust me - after a few days, you’ll feel human again. And if you don’t know what to do with all that extra time? Read. It might just rewire your brain in the best way possible.✺⭆["The really sad part was when I was scrolling Google news like it was instagram. Literally, doing the thumb motion as if some new story was going to be down there somewhere, but it was just the same articles I'd already read.\xa0\n\n\nNow I'm in this weird place where I only have YouTube shorts, and I feel very, very guilty when I catch myself scrolling endlessly while thinking it's time to stop, but the action of 'stopping' always involves scrolling to one more clip to see if it's something cool. And that opens you up to another phase of uncontrolled scrolling.\xa0\n\n\nStay strong Friends. A movement is starting and we're just the early adopters of living in the real world again, ha.", 'This is such a solid breakdown of digital detox and why it’s so necessary! The way social media rewires our brains is honestly scary, and I love the book recommendations—*Stolen Focus* and *The Shallows* hit hard. Totally agree that boredom is underrated; once I started embracing it, my creativity and focus improved so much. Going offline feels impossible at first, but the clarity and peace that come after are worth it. Thanks for sharing your experience!']
1jatsz3✺⭆getdisciplined✺⭆How I went from chronically lazy to disciplined in 2 years. (Full Guide on Self-Discipline)✺⭆Hey good day, I’m someone who used to be chronically lazy, fat and couldn’t focus on anything for more than 10 minutes 2 years ago. Now I lost 10 kg, do 3 hours of deep work in the morning, follow a 12 hour daily schedule and no longer have trouble fighting laziness.\n\nI’m here to share what helped from my journey of laziness to disciplined. I hope you take away something useful in this post.\n\nBuckle in. This post is long. Grab a notebook and pen you can use to take down notes.\n\n**This post to those who are struggling and can’t seem to fix their laziness. You probably struggled for a lot of time already. I now and I’ve been there. If you’re reading this, make this is your break through.**\n\n**(TLDR can be found at the bottom of the post. Though I highly recommend reading the whole article to understand the connection and how they each part interacts with each other.**\n\nAnd I’d like to start with:\n\nThe only way out is to stay consistent. Even if you waste days, weeks, or months if you keep putting in the work you'll gradually build that discipline you wanted.\n\nWe are humans and our energy is limited. This means if you’re goal is to never procrastinate again that mindset is wrong. Your goal should be to lessen your entertainment consumption using the 2 E’S.\n\nE 1 is for EDUCATION:\n\n* The amount of time you use to make your value to the world higher. Meaning your skills, abilities and capabilities. Because the better you are at something the more likely you are to keep doing it.\n\nE 2 is for ENTERTAINMENT:\n\n* This goes to the amount of time you waste. While I do not recommend wasting time, we are humans and we make mistakes. When you mess up forgive yourself. I mess up plenty of times too.\n\nWhy do you need to know all of this?\n\n# DOPAMINE.\n\nThe reason we want to do something is to experience feelings. The chemicals in your body that fire’s you up when you’re excited and makes you sad when someone says hurtful things to you.\n\nThis is what motivates and moves us. We as humans are driven by dopamine. Andrew Huberman said it best. *“Dopamine is war. It’s drive and motivation”.*\n\nNo matter what we do is driven by dopamine.\n\nLike what you do?\n\n* → Increases Dopamine.\n\nHate what you do?\n\n* → Lowers dopamine\n\nWhen I didn’t know any of this. I always wondered why I was wasting time. I was awake till 12am and still out there scrolling in social media and watching highly edited videos.\n\nEven though I was filling my mind with dopamine I was still having trouble knowing what to do.\n\n# Fixing laziness through dopamine.\n\nIf you’re someone who stays in bed, naps all day and can’t seem to do anything productively that’s because your brain is fried. Everything you do is boring so why do it at all? I know because I was like that too.\n\nWhen dopamine is over the top and it’s too much. Your body won’t move or want to do anything unless the stimuli in your brain is higher. And good habits have very low stimuli in our brains but bad habits spike them to the top.\n\nThe way to fix this is simple.\n\n* Schedule what time you want to waste and laze around. This sounds counter productive but if you look at your screen time. It’s probably over 10 hours if you aren’t lying. So if you schedule 3 hours of time wasting, this means you’ve just gained 7 hours of time. I had mine for over 12 hours and I decided to waste 4 hours. I got back 8 hours of time.\n* Journal what you do throughout the day and minimize all activities that causes a big spike in dopamine. Meaning your bad habits need to be regulated. I made progress when I become aware I was spending over 12 hours on my phone daily.\n* Make your education time than entertainment higher. For example you do 2 hours of entertainment, then you have to put up with doing 2hours and 10 minutes of education. Though this might be too much if you’re new. I highly suggest doing at least 10 minutes of education if you can’t overdrive your entertainment. Don’t let the ego get in the way too.\n\n# Habit formation. How to do it right.\n\nThe key to habit building is making it easy. Do not rely on motivation. It’s a friend that comes when you don’t want to and goes away when you need it the most. Use will power instead. But not the will power like “David Goggin’s” ultra discipline type. I found this the most useful.\n\nHere’s the process:\n\n1. Make it stupidly easy - If you are new to the gym you wouldn’t bench press 100kg. You would start with the empty barbell. The same principle goes to building habits. You make it stupidly easy it’s impossible to fail. This means instead of doing meditation for 1 hour you do 1 minute. This sounds cringe but it works. Back then I couldn’t even be productive for 30 minutes. So I decided to stick to doing 1 thing everyday for 10 minutes. I made the requirement so small that I could do it even in bad days.\n2. Don’t do it twice when you mess up - You have to stay consistent on the thing you’ve set on. You must not over do it when you skipped yesterday. This causes problems and makes you intimidated to start instead. Don’t do 2 hours of studying because you missed yesterdays 1 hour of studying session. It doesn’t work. I always felt more intimidated of doing the work instead of motivated.\n3. Stay consistent - Do not quit if you’ve been having trouble of had problems. If you got off for a week get back to it as soon as possible. You must never quit forever. You can take breaks but never forever. The key is to get back on track as soon as possible. That way you can stick and actually make results later. I was on and off my good habits. I would skip days and sometimes weeks. Just get back to it as soon as possible.\n\n# Sleep. How it helps you overcome laziness.\n\nSleep is the best legal performance enhancing drug. So if you only sleep around 4-5 hours like I did obviously you won’t feel productive and energetic.\n\nSince energy plays a vital role in becoming disciplined.\n\n* More energy = Higher chances of being productive.\n* Less energy = Higher chances of being lazy.\n\nI remember when I would sleep at 12 am the next day I would feel sluggish and tired. I would always scroll first thing in the morning and waste at least 2 hours watching in YouTube.\n\nBut now I don’t and I fixed it. I slept early, got more energy and actually became disciplined. I even have sometimes too much energy throughout the day that I get shocked at how much I get done.\n\nTo fix your sleep I recommend 3 things. This is how I also did it.\n\n1. Tire your body - The reason you are not able to sleep fast at night is because your body isn’t tired. This means your body is not seeking rest or recovery. And when it isn’t, it doesn’t want to sleep. It wants to use that energy and get tired. So tire your body during the morning and you’ll have an easier time to sleep. I decided to clean our house more than required. Enough to make me tired at nighttime.\n2. Schedule - You need to sleep daily and consistently everyday. This way your body clock gets regulated and fixed. You’ll have to put up not being able to sleep properly for a few days but once you get this rolling it becomes easier. I found this easy to follow once you practice it over a week.\n3. No phone 1 hour before bed - Blue light causes our eyes to go dry and makes our mind stay awake. This means you need to stay away from screens near your bedtime. That way you’ll have an easier time to sleep and stay on track. I always notice the difference when I would scroll before sleeping. My eyes would dry out and cause my brain to stay alert. But if I don’t I can feel my eyes being sleepy helping me sleep faster.\n\n# Don’t trust motivation. Use will power instead.\n\nMotivation cannot be trusted. It’s like a toxic friend that comes when you don’t want to and comes away when you need it. Instead of relying on watching motivational videos and indulging in mindless consumption. I highly recommend just accepting the suck.\n\n**The suck is doing the hard work you don’t want to do. It’s painful and uncomfortable but you do it. And that’s how you build will power. I made progress when I accepted I have to put in the work even if I don’t want to. But the problem is most people do it too hard. They do 1 hour of meditation or 1 hour of exercise and you’ll end up not doing it since it’s too hard. Been there too.**\n\nHere’s what to do instead:\n\n* Choose 1 thing you don’t want to do. E.g. working out or waking up early or doing house chores.\n* Do the bare minimum. Don’t do 1 hour of meditation. Do 1 minute instead.\n* Schedule when you are going to do it. Early in the morning? Afternoon? Evening?\n* Be specific about it. What time? 6am? 7am? 12nn? 8pm?\n\nI was down bad back in the days. Focusing for even 10 minutes was close to impossible. So I decided to lower the bar so low it made it impossible for me to fail.\n\nOver time you should add more habits. The good ones.\n\n# Good habits.\n\nThere are a lot of good habits I can talk about but I will only tackle 3. Which were the most helpful in my discipline journey.\n\n* Tracker journal - Everyday before sleeping I wrote down what I did. This made me more inspired and motivated to work harder.\n* Working out- The more I built my muscles the more confident I got. This made me more inclined to keep doing my good habits.\n* Reading- I didn’t start reading physical books. Those were too intimidating. I started reading digitally in my phone using some app that summarizes book learnings. It would only take me 5 minutes a day which made it easier to do.\n\nThis habits came about after 2 months after I’ve built some foundation.\n\nThis 3 habits built my foundation of discipline. Yours will be different but with similar habits. You don’t have to follow mine but it’s a good start if you don’t know what to do.\n\n**I also highly recommend reading the summary to really internalize all of this information.**\n\nTLDR (Summary) :\n\n* Education should overdrive entertainment. Since if you don’t you fry your dopamine reward system. Aim to at least make your education time higher than entertainment everyday. If you can’t keep trying.\n* Dopamine controls what we do. We are prone to do pleasurable activities such as doom scrolling because it’s considered fun by the brain. Lower your dopamine baseline by gradually eliminating bad habits. To ensure the habits you do are pleasurable and fun. The lower your dopamine the better and easier it is for you to do hard work while having fun.\n* Your habits dictate your future. Build the right habits by 1) Making it stupidly easy 2) Don’t do twice if you skipped a day 3) Forgive yourself when you mess up.\n* Fix your sleep and your productivity skyrockets. Sleep is the best performance enhancing drug. The more energy you get from sleep the better your chances of doing hard things. To sleep better 1) Tire your body during the day with physical activities 2) Schedule bed time 3) No phone in 1 hour before bed.\n* Don’t trust motivation and use will power. Motivation is unreliable. Will power on the other hand will make you mentally stronger and makes it easier for you do to hard work. Lower the bar so low it’s impossible to fail. e.g. 1 minute of meditation over 1 hour.\n* Good habits are good for consistency. Read, workout and track your daily activities. This makes you more motivated and healthy overall.\n\nI hoped you liked this summary. If this is hard to understand I highly recommend reading the whole post. It contains life changing information that you might be looking for.\n\nAnd if you'd like I have a premium ["Delete Procrastination Cheat Sheet"](https://www.theimprovementletter.com/) you can use to get faster progress at overcoming laziness.

1jt2dn3✺⭆gamedev✺⭆The Story of How Our Game Made Almost $500K Gross in 1 Month After a Year of Development✺⭆This is going to be a long and detailed post—so buckle up if you're into that kind of thing! Otherwise, here’s a TL;DR (that’s still kinda long).\n\nWhile writing this, I realized just how much info there is to share, so I edited it down. If other devs are interested, I’d be happy to follow up with more detailed posts—especially about our ad strategy during Next Fest or anything else you'd like to dive deeper into.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nWe released a successful game after 1 year of development, as a studio that's been together for 5 years. Despite a great launch, we made a number of mistakes that led to fair criticism in reviews. We’re actively working on improvements through updates, but here’s the overall timeline of we got here:\n\n* **Feb 2024**: Secured funding\n* **Mar 2024**: Selected *Do No Harm* as our primary project\n* **June 2024**: Showcased early version at Baku Game Summit, got feedback from Rami Ismail, redesigned core loop\n* **Late Sep 2024**: Steam page goes live, \~1500 wishlists in 1 week (\~500 on Day 1)\n* **Jan 29, 2025**: Trailer launches, \~14,400 total wishlists right before that\n* **Feb 24 (Next Fest)**: \~50K wishlists right before (Jan 29–Feb 23 avg: 1431/day, peak: 3712)\n* **Next Fest**: Top #50 demo, median playtime: 52 minutes\n* **Mar 6 (Launch)**: 105K wishlists\n* **Launch Metrics**:\n   * Day 1: \~7.5K units / \~$82K gross\n   * Week 1: \~26K units / \~$280K gross\n   * Month 1: \~44K units / \~$480K gross\n* **Next steps**: Major update in 3–6 weeks to address community feedback, and maybe console port in a few months.\n\n# Why I'm Sharing This\n\nThis post isn’t to advertise (gamedevs aren’t really our target audience) or to brag. I was inspired by other transparent devs like Alex Blintsov (*Furnish Master*), who openly shared his data with the community. While I won’t go quite as deep, I want to talk about what worked, what didn’t, and what we learned along the way while making [*Do No Harm*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/). Also, this is not exactly Post-Mortem (I wasn't sure what other tag to choose), as I don't consider our game dead yet - we are planning to continue working on it for a while. But maybe in a year or so, I'll do a full post-mortem focusing specifically on our mistakes.\n\n# Background\n\nWe founded our studio in 2019 with six devs, all with some experience in games. Our first project was overly ambitious, and by 2021 it had to be put on hold due to scope creep and lack of experience. We turned to outsourcing to stay afloat, while occasionally experimenting with smaller internal projects.\n\nAfter almost 3 years of outsourcing and through a round of raising funds from an angel investor, we finally secured enough funding to commit to internal development full-time for one year. To reduce risk, we split our efforts into three separate projects—each with a 4-month dev cycle. *Do No Harm* was one of them.\n\n# How We Chose the Game\n\nWith our team now at 13 people, everyone pitched their own game ideas. We voted internally and shortlisted three concepts. Then, the senior team picked the most viable one based on two key factors:\n\n* **Market demand**: Using tools like SteamDB, SteamTrends, and Gamalytics to analyze competition and genre viability.\n* **Feasibility**: We imposed hard scope limitations—e.g., the entire game had to take place in a single environment.\n\nThat left us with two finalists:\n\n* A *Papers, Please*\-style spooky doctor sim\n* An *FTL*\-like steampunk mecha game\n\nWhile the *FTL*\-like seemed safer, we believed the doctor game had more potential if executed right. Our lead designer who came up with the idea in the first place, Omar Israfilov, was especially passionate about the idea, and we decided to go all in.\n\n# Early Development\n\nThe original prototype looked and especially played very differently from the current game. We aimed for a 2D/3D blend, inspired by *The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack*—juxtaposing smooth character art with grotesque close-ups. Our art team (who had previously done AAA outsourcing) worked hard to achieve this style, though technical and time constraints forced some compromises. Here is [Evolution of Art post](https://imgur.com/a/G4Q8HgC) (it's missing some stages that I will add later on).\n\nBy June 2024, at the Baku Game Summit, the game was focused on deduction using the symptoms the patients would give you, and combing through the Book of Medicine for treatment methods. The biggest difference from the current version was that you’d always find the correct answer in the book if you looked carefully enough while now you have to take some risks and work with imperfect information. The Lovecraftian elements were also barely there.\n\nPlayers at the event showed interest, but also clear sign of boredom. Our initial plan was to just add more features or raise the difficulty curve, but then we met Rami Ismail, who gave us some amazing advice: instead of pure logic puzzles, shift the game mechanics to taking calculated risks and making informed guesses.\n\nThis became the core loop: "fuzzy" decisions over rigid deduction. Humor and tension emerged from the uncertainty. His advice helped us make the core loop more about making educated guesses and taking informed risks with your treatment methods instead of simply solving the disease by combing through the Book of Medicine. This change we made resulted in Humor Circle and a much more interesting playthrough. It made the game more engaging—but it also meant we had to rebuild key systems. Eventually, we committed fully to *Do No Harm* and dropped/delayed the other two projects.\n\n# On Publishers and the Steam Page\n\nNow, one of the pieces of advice we also got was to not publish a Steam Page on our own, but rather contact publishers first and see if we can get any of them interested. Our main goal with contacting publishers wasn’t to get funding, but rather to find someone who would multiply our marketing efforts. That said, we did believe that the game was a potential mini-hit so we were looking for someone to cover our costs especially now that we decided to take the risk of only making one project in a year putting all of our funds into it. \n\nWe reached out to 50 publishers over 4 months. None met our minimum terms. Most only responded after we hit 6K+ wishlists and landed on the “Popular Upcoming” list. I'm going to make a separate post about our experience with publishers and my thoughts on the whole process.\n\nIn hindsight, waiting for a publishers was a mistake. Unless you're an established name or have an amazing or highly addicitve near-finished vertical slice, publishers will likely pass. Meanwhile, a live Steam page can help generate community interest and improve your bargaining power. It let us refine tags, get early feedback, and most importantly build our Discord.\n\nThe Playtest feature was especially helpful. We even used playtesters' responses to help set the price at $15.99 using a basic pricing survey formula (happy to share more about that if anyone's curious).\n\n# Marketing and Next Fest\n\nSeeing no success from getting publishers even after I presented in front of a great panel at the [Playcon event](https://playcon.gg/2024-event/indie-initiative/) that I was invited to in Malta - I understood that if we want the game to succeed we need to do more. After realizing we’d likely self-publish (outside China, where we partnered with Hawthorn Games), we focused on visibility. We secured a [trailer slot on GameTrailers](https://youtu.be/RCyjUzA9V08)—and surprisingly, it blew up. That traction helped us get picked up by IGN’s main YouTube channel too.\n\nWishlists went from \~100/day to \~1500/day almost overnight.\n\nWe launched a separate demo page on Feb 4 with two goals:\n\n1. Get more eyes on the game and thus feedback. Fix core issues before Next Fest\n2. Use Steam’s Demo Release Email to notify 40K wishlisters about the demo 1 week before the NextFest\n\nHaving the demo early paid off. It generated word of mouth and allowed us to polish based on the incoming reviews. Next Fest then took the demo results to the next level. We cracked the top 50 demos with a median playtime of 52 minutes despite having only 7 days worth of content (each day being 6 minutes long).\n\nThe NextFest itself was incredibly exciting and nerve-wracking for us. Especially because we knew that almost immediately after the Fest we’d have to release the game. The decision to release that soon instead of continue to polish was based on two things:\n\n1. We kind of had to. Our funds were running out, and we only had 1-2 more months of burn-rate in us.\n2. We wanted to use the peak of the hype for our game, as well as get some benefit from the Spring Sales via our Launch Discount.\n\nWe tried reaching out to media for another outreach attempt with our Release trailer on March 6th, but due to how delayed its production was, and given how focused we were on fixing all of the issues of the game, we only managed to finish the trailer by March 3rd. That was too late, and I think it was a marketing beat opportunity we lost.\n\n# Launch\n\nThe final pre-launch thing we did was bundling up with Death & Taxes (for an additional 20% discount). We reached out to more games, but unfortunately didn’t get to bundle in time. With hype at its peak and funds running low, we released on March 6, just 1 hour after finishing the final build (definitely don’t recommend doing that!). We launched with a 10% launch discount. Despite all of the flaws of the game, the response blew us away:\n\n* **105K wishlists at launch**\n* **Day 1:** 7.5K units / \~$82K gross\n* **Week 1:** 26K units / \~$280K gross\n* **Month 1:** 44K units / \~$480K gross\n\nLooking at our reviews it becomes clear that we didn’t manage to implement the philosophy of fuzzy choices as well as we wanted to, and most importantly we didn’t communicate the way it works well. We also have issues with balancing and overall pacing of the game - but given that Do No Harm is our first big release, I still consider what we have done a huge success - especially if we continue to improve upon what we have. \n\nBeyond the numbers, the community has been incredible. The money we have earned has made us very happy, and secure in our future plans, but to be honest the support of our community on Discord, the fan arts, as well as all the YouTube and Twitch streams even from influencer we never reached out to is the main reason we got into gamedev and stuck with it despite 4-5 years of failing to release a game leading to this point. The feeling of seeing so many other people play and enjoy your game (even if they do rightfully complain about certain parts) is incredible.\n\n# What’s Next\n\nWe’re working on a Major update to address feedback (especially around balancing, pacing, and communicating the core game loop better). We have also added a few of the most active community members as characters into the game. \n\nBut beyond the game I’m also giving back to the team that has worked on the game. The whole team got a short paid vacation to spend time with family after the exhausting development we were through. I’ve also increased the wages of everyone on the team, as well as given a bonus based on the net income of the company, in addition to the shares of the company. I believe that in my team we aren’t making games for the studio or investors, but for ourselves (team members) and the general community. I want everyone on the team to be able to say proudly that they’ve made a game, rather than just worked on a title. Now we also have a dedicated community, and I hope that we’ll be able to keep them engaged and interested with our future games.\n\nLonger term our focus is to:\n\n* Fix internal production and documentation pipelines\n* Start work on a new game (while continuing to support *Do No Harm*)\n* Explore console and mobile ports for Do No Harm\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is our first real release after 4–5 years of trying and failing. It’s far from perfect—but it’s a massive step forward for our studio. If you’re in a similar position, I hope our story gives you a realistic, but hopeful perspective.\n\nFeel free to ask questions—I'll try to answer as best I can (might be a bit slow though as it’s nighttime for me).✺⭆["well thought thru, well executed and a result to show for it.  Well done.  And thanks for sharing.  These types of stories show there's still success to be had . From solo to team need to think smartly professionally about their strategy while still executing with passion. Which is what you've seemingly done.\n\nLovely!", 'Fantastic post and congratulations on the success. Really appreciate sharing your experiences, we are in a very similar position.']

1kfek13✺⭆getdisciplined✺⭆How do people actually generate wealth✺⭆I'm talking about true ways by which you achieved financial independence that cant be thought in schools. Proven ways that may seem unconventional for others but works for you.✺⭆["Get a good paying job, live like you're broke, and put the rest into index ETFs (VTSAX). Start early and let interest work in your favour for a change instead of against it", '1.) Spend less than you earn. Full stop. The rest of what I\'m going to say is ancillary, and in support of this number one rule. Take a few days to calculate your budget and adjust where necessary to be in the black month to month. Above all else, spend less than you earn.\n\n2.) Pay yourself first because God knows no one else will. When you were born you took on a debt to your future self. Only after you pay what you owe that handsome devil (set aside a little bit in savings, even if it\'s only $5 or $20), you may pay the rest of your debts and bills. Don\'t have enough left over to pay your other debts? Tough shit, earn some more money or work some OT.\n\n3.) You don\'t need credit, you need cash. Things cost dollars, not credit score. If you don\'t have enough cash to buy the thing, you can\'t buy the thing. Credit is a tool. You\'re not spending your money, you\'re spending their money. Credit cards will help build good standing with financial institutions and some cards give you cashback rewards. But don\'t ever rack up more than is in your bank account. Always pay it off early and often.\n\n4.) Emergency Fund: save 6 months expenses, minimum. Then to bolster that savings, plan for preventative maintenance on the things you own. "Hey I\'ve got an oil change coming up. Better set aside money for it!" That way you won\'t get caught unawares by an exploding hot water tank, and even if you do you can cover it and everything else that\'s about to go wrong because bad news comes in 3\'s.\n\n5.) Max out any employer-matched retirement plans. Then Max out an IRA. Go to r/personalfinance for more info. Invest those retirement funds into ETFs if you can. "VOO and chill" is the saying over at r/fire (financial independence, retire early).\n\n6.) Take a little out every once in a while to celebrate the life you\'re given. It\'s good to be a super saver and spendthrift, but not to the point of misery.\n\nThat\'s what\'s worked for me, anyway. \n\nEdit: My only debt is my mortgage, and I\'ve never spent more than $10k on a vehicle.

1kdyb16✺⭆getdisciplined✺⭆How I stopped being a dopamine zombie (and actually got shit done again)✺⭆This year I realized I was basically a walking dopamine junkie. Phone glued to my hand. YouTube playing in the background 24/7. Brain so fried I couldn’t read a full paragraph without checking Reddit. I felt like my attention span was cooked.\n\nSo I spent 30 days resetting my brain — not with cheesy self-help books, but actual stuff that worked. Here’s what helped me go from brain-fried to actually disciplined again:\n\nPhase 1: Dopamine detox (the real kind)\n	•	Phone went grayscale. Insta and TikTok became boring overnight.\n	•	No social media before 12PM. Morning brain is sacred now.\n	•	Blocked Reddit + YouTube during work hours. Cold-turkey. It hurt, but it worked.\n	•	Made a “dopamine menu” — stuff that gives long-term joy: workouts, walking outside, journaling. When I get the itch to scroll, I pick one from the list.\n\nPhase 2: Mental bootcamp\n	•	Woke up and made my bed immediately — it’s dumb but it flips a switch.\n	•	Cold showers every morning. Instant reset button.\n	•	10-minute “mind dump” journaling every night. Stops the 2AM overthinking spiral.\n	•	Practiced just sitting in silence for 5 minutes. No music. No phone. No stimulus. Surprisingly hard — and that’s why it works.\n\nPhase 3: Discipline by design\n	•	Created a “shutdown” ritual at night — lights off, screens off, book out. Brain starts winding down automatically now.\n	•	Broke my work into 90-minute blocks with real breaks. Way more sustainable than grinding nonstop.\n	•	Took the pressure off being “perfect.” Missed a day? Whatever. Show up tomorrow.\n	•	Set 1 non-negotiable task per day. Do that, day’s a win. Bonus tasks = extra points.\n\nSmall habits that had big results:\n	•	Chew gum while working (weirdly helps me focus).\n	•	Switched coffee to matcha + L-theanine. No more jittery crashes.\n	•	Set up a time-locking box for my phone. Game changer.\n	•	Box breathing (4-4-4-4). Sounds cheesy. Works.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nI didn’t “hack” my brain. I just stopped poisoning it 24/7 and gave it space to work. If you’re stuck, don’t overcomplicate it. Just start. Build a system that helps you show up even when you feel like crap.✺⭆['This post has a dusting of the book deep work by cal newport (I’m reading it now).  Good on ya and keep going.', 'I really like the idea of a dopamine menu.

1ki3odn✺⭆gamedev✺⭆I made 5k wishlists in my first Month on Steam, here is what i learned and how i turned sick!✺⭆# 1. Game Info / Steampage\n\n*(skip to next point if not interested)*\n\n**Name:** Fantasy World Manager\n\n**Developer:** Florian Alushaj Games\n\n**Publisher:**  Florian Alushaj Games\n\n**Steampage:** [**https://store.steampowered.com/app/3447280?utm\_source=postmortem1**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3447280?utm_source=postmortem1)\n\n**Discord:**  [https://discord.gg/vHCZQ3EJJ8](https://discord.gg/vHCZQ3EJJ8)\n\n**Current Wishlists:** 4,781\n\n# 2. Pre-Launch Actions\n\ni frequently got asked what i did on my Page Launch Day to bundle alot of traffic Day 1, here is what i did:\n\n**a) Discord Communities**\n\ni got Discord Premium, this allows me to join ALOT more Discord Servers in general. I have joined over 30 Gamedev related Discords that allow advertising. I have posted atleast weekly on each one of them since i started the project, which was in December 2024.\n\nYou should not underestimate the power of those Discord Communities. While it ultimately might not convert many wishlists or mostly "poor" ones which might never convert, you get to meet other devs that like what you do, that already have experience or that have similar games like you to partner up or help each other.\n\ni have met alot of people that work for small indie studios that have released several games on steam, they gave me alot of tips for my first game, the most frequent ones:\n\n* Do proper Market Research\n   * its really important to check similar games and how games in your genre perform (median)\n   * find out what games you could combine, what you could do better - you dont have to reinvent the wheel.\n   * dont try make the 9988th vampire survivors, dont make the 9988th stardew valley, those are exceptions and not the norm. instead learn from them, what is the hook?\n* **Connect with other Devs**\n   * as already stated, other devs can be really valueable contacts and i definitely can call some of my dev contacts friends at this point, your friends are very biased no matter what you show them but your dev friends will be very honest if you ask for feedback\n* **KEEP ASKING FOR FEEDBACK**\n   * dont stop asking for feedback where-ever you can! you may have fun with your project, playing it yourself, but you are biased! showcase new stuff, no matter if its just your first Draft - people on reddit and discord are really good at giving feedback for improvements.\n* **Do not quit your job**\n   * Dont..dont...dont!\n   * expect your first game to be a "failure" in terms of revenue\n   * use your first game as your deep dive in all aspects of gamedev (including promotion &  (paid) marketing\n* **LOCALIZATION**\n   * this is so important, please localize your steampage!!! you will see why later.\n\n**b) Reddit**\n\n**I have made around 30 posts between December and 6th April (Steam Page Launch)**\n\n**they gained 1.3 Million Views and 14.000 Upvotes, over 1.000 shares. My Creator Page got 70+ Followers, my Reddit Account got 60+ Followers.**\n\n50% of those posts were not selfpromotion, they were progress updates in the r/godot community (check my profile) but alot of people saw my game and kept it in mind, because i posted frequently, and people kept pushing my posts!\n\n**c) thats it...**\n\nyou may have expected way more, but thats everything i did pre-steam-page-launch. However, my Reddit posts were a sign that my game does really well on Reddit. - thats important for post-launch activities i did.\n\n# 3. Launch Day\n\n**Those are the things i did on Launch Day:**\n\na) i posted on ALL Discord Communites i am part of that i launched my Steampage and asked for support! If i sum the reactions i got up in all those communitys, i got over 200 Reactions, i didnt UTM track those unfortunately but it definitely had an Traffic Impact.\n\nb) i made reddit posts in some subreddits, those posts gained  around 120k views combined, 300 shares.also here i didnt know that utm tracklinks existed but from the steam stats i could tell alot of traffic was from reddit.\n\n**Tose are the the things that happened without me doing anything on Launch Day:**\n\na) 4gamer article + twitter post:\n\nthe japanese magacine 4gamer posted my game, they just picked it up organically - if it was not localized in japanese, they would never have found my steam page. Thanks to their article i gained 700 wishlists from japan in the first 24 hours.\n\nthis combined with my own effort made me around 1,100 wishlists in the first day.\n\n# 4.) What happened since then?\n\nI made another Reddit post in gamedev,indiedev,worldbuilding some days after, which made me another 700 wishlists. Then i started getting quiet, i didnt post anymore for almost a Month. My Organic wishlists were 100 for a few day, it went down to 30-40.  Without me doing anything i was gaining those daily wishlists.. which was and still is really crazy.\n\n# 5.) Paid Reddit Ads\n\nAfter i reached 2.100 wishlists (17th april) i was certain that my game is really being liked on reddit, it was time to take the advice from fellow devs i met and try out reddit ads and hell yeah, it was the best decision. Since 17th April i have been running ads, i have made atleast 1600 wishlists with a spent budget of 400€ , those are the UTM tracked wishlists, which is an investment of 0,26€ per wishlist.\n\nMy Ads are still running, and i will keep them running until the demo releases. If you advertise in the right Subreddits, you will find your audience! Those are not "poor" wishlists as many people rant about. Many Contacts told me publishers usually do a big bugdet reddit ad campaign until your game has 7k wishlists and then they stop.\n\nSo why not do the same strategy?\n\n**My tips:**\n\n**1. Go for Conversion in your AD Campaign**\n\n**2. it does not matter if you use Carousel,Video,Image, i prefer Carousel**\n\n**3. Only include countries you localize for**\n\n**4. US should be in its own campaign, set your CPC to 0.30 , it will perform well enough**\n\n**5. Leave your Comments on, reply to people. i ahve really good experience with that (60+ comments on my ads)**\n\n**6. Also bring in people to your discord, i crossed 100 people today, its really cool to have people that love your game,it boosts motivation so high and you got playtesters!**\n\n# 6. NUMBER SICKNESS! CAREFUL!\n\nThis is really crazy, but if your game performs well with numbers.. stop looking at your numbers.. dont do it! I did that and i did only that for atleast a week, doing nothing for the game - just starring at those raising numbers and when one day it dropped a bit, i felt some panic!  I felt like the game is gonna fail while still performing better tan 90% of indie projects (firsts).\n\ni am only checking numbers weekly since that happened to me.\n\nwell..thats it.. i hope it was interesting. feel free to ask more questions!✺⭆['Thats a great result especially with no trailer! You probably would have hit 20K with a trailer!', 'You sneaky you! I actually clicked on an ad earlier as it caught my eye!\nGood luck!', "What's the use of wishlists if they dont turn into buyers?\n\nOr this is expectation growth before actual launch?\n\nHmm how do you even price your game so it converts into a winner and not a break even situation (revenue = ad * effort spent)"]

1kja4zu✺⭆SaaS✺⭆Stop making stupid SaaS and start solving real niche problems✺⭆It's always SaaS Groundhog Day on this community...\n\nAnother post, another AI copywriting tool that requires a PhD to figure out. Or, I am being invited to the 12th Product Hunt clone that’s gone live this month.\n\nYou all are fighting for scraps in oversaturated markets while actual businesses with money are BEGGING for solutions to real problems.\n\nThe gold mine isn't in your generic tracker app, nobody will pay for. It's in those unsexy niches where companies are desperate enough to throw cash at anyone who understands their actual pain points.\n\nStop chasing the SaaS hype train and start solving problems people actually have. Your bank account will thank you.\n\nHere are ten ideas for niche SaaS products that one of you should start building today.\n\n# Regulated Industries\n\n* Idea: HIPAA-compliant messaging platform for small medical clinics.\n* Why it's smart: Healthcare providers require secure communication tools that comply with strict regulations. Offering a HIPAA-compliant messaging solution addresses this critical need, ensuring patient data privacy and facilitating efficient communication within clinics.\n\n# Niche B2B Vertical Tools\n\n* Idea: Scheduling and management software tailored for pet groomers.\n* Why it's smart: Generic scheduling tools often lack features specific to pet grooming businesses. A specialized platform can offer functionalities like pet profiles, vaccination tracking, and breed-specific grooming notes, directly catering to the unique needs of this niche market.\n\n# Internal Tools for Non-Tech Teams\n\n* Idea: Onboarding portals designed for HR departments.\n* Why it's smart: Human Resources teams frequently rely on outdated systems or spreadsheets for onboarding. A dedicated portal streamlines the process, ensuring consistency, compliance, and a better experience for new hires.\n\n# Data & Reporting Automation\n\n* Idea: Automated reporting tools that sync e-commerce analytics to spreadsheets.\n* Why it's smart: Manually compiling reports from platforms like Shopify is time-consuming and error-prone. Automating this process saves time, reduces mistakes, and provides real-time insights for better decision-making.\n\n# Boring Business Back-Office\n\n* Idea: Small chain store documentation management system.\n* Why it's smart: Small chain stores deal with extensive documentation, from training manuals to compliance forms. A centralized system ensures consistency across locations and simplifies updates, which is crucial for maintaining brand standards.\n\n# Event-Specific Tools\n\n* Idea: Management software for niche events like science fairs or hackathons.\n* Why it's smart: Such events have unique requirements, including participant registration, project submissions, and judging criteria. A tailored tool addresses these specific needs, enhancing the experience for organizers and participants.\n\n# Low-Code / No-Code Enablers\n\n* Idea: A workflow automation platform for specific industries, like legal or real estate.\n* Why it's smart: Professionals in these fields often lack technical expertise but need customized solutions. A low-code platform empowers them to build and modify workflows without coding, increasing efficiency and adaptability.\n\n# SaaS for Creators (Beyond Content Tools)\n\n* Idea: Income tracking and financial management tool for digital creators.\n* Why it's smart: Digital creators often juggle multiple income streams, making financial tracking complex. A dedicated tool simplifies income management, tax preparation, and financial planning, allowing artists to focus on their creative work.\n\n# Operations Software for Physical Businesses\n\n* Idea: Route planning and scheduling software for neighborhood service providers like pool cleaners.\n* Why it's smart: Mobile service businesses need efficient route planning to save time and fuel. A specialized tool optimizes schedules and routes, enhancing productivity and customer satisfaction.\n\n# APIs for Niche Data or Services\n\n* Idea: A sentiment analysis of local political campaigns, enabling real-time tracking of voter sentiment within specific districts or municipalities.\n* Why it works: Local campaigns often lack the resources for extensive polling or data analysis. This tool provides affordable, real-time insights into voter opinions by analyzing social media, local news, and community forums.\n\nNow, anyone who got this far, I know what you’re going to say. So I wrote an FAQ to address all the questions that the trolls will post in response.\n\n# FAQ\n\n# What if there are already competitors in the niche?\n\nGreat! Competitors validate market demand. Most niches aren't winner-take-all. Focus on specific pain points they're neglecting or target an underserved segment. Being second in a proven market often beats being first in an unproven one.\n\n# I tried XYZ idea before and it failed\n\nYes, new businesses do fail all the time. This isn't a surprise. But if you focus on a clear and obvious problem for a niche audience, you have a much better shot at success than building a SaaS tool with no obvious market. And be sure to validate your idea at each step.\n\n# I don't know anything about this industry. How can I build for it?\n\nInterview 5-10 potential customers. Join industry forums and attend trade shows. Consider partnering with someone who has domain expertise. The knowledge barrier actually protects you from generic competitors who won't put in the work.\n\n# How do I price a niche SaaS product?\n\nDon't underprice. Niche products often command premium rates because they solve specialized problems. Research what businesses currently spend on alternatives, then price based on value delivered, not just your costs. Many B2B niche products can justify $100 to $500+ monthly.\n\n# How do I find these niche opportunities?\n\nLook for industries still using spreadsheets or outdated software. Talk to friends in non-tech fields. Browse industry forums for recurring complaints. The best niches are hiding in plain sight, just invisible to founders fixated with posting on this community.\n\n# Won't these markets be too small?\n\nA focused $3M business serving a specific niche beats a failed unicorn attempt. Many niches are larger than they appear and can support multiple successful companies. Starting narrow doesn't mean staying narrow. You can always expand after establishing your foundation.\n\n# How do I market to these niche audiences?\n\nForget growth hacking. Go where your audience already gathers, like industry conferences, trade publications, and specialized communities. One industry influencer or respected customer case study often opens more doors than thousands spent on generic marketing.✺⭆['Thanks for the ideas ChatGPT.. and you of course are there to help the to-be-founders to market these ideas lol.', 'This is straight from Chagpt bro common.

1kipp0o✺⭆SoloDevelopment✺⭆Can you make a living as an indie dev without going viral?✺⭆I know it’s technically possible but I’m curious if there is anyone here that makes games full time without making a viral hit or having massive success. I’m not talking about millions of dollars, just a steady income to let you pay the bills, put food on the table and keep making games full time.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who’s doing it right now or has seen it done. What kind of games are you making? What kind of strategies, platforms or release schedules have worked for you?✺⭆['There are a lot of GDC talks on this topic. Study them. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/JmwbYl6f11c?si=DEzqhn_89NM3BqEo\n\nhttps://youtu.be/stxVBJem3Rs?si=tjdyyH9wVMxUg_RD\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YaUdstkv1RE?si=rXFfa6E3AgltrZT9', 'I\'ve been on teams before where at least one person was living off debt during development. It doesn\'t work. They just produce poor quality because they\'re stressed and under the gun. \n\nThe best indie devs don\'t need to be successful. It shouldn\'t be a gamble with your livelihood.\n\nYou get a lot of "jump and the net will appear" people in game dev. And it\'s not something I recommend. If you\'re looking for a living, do non-game dev first. The market is way more forgiving on general software dev because it\'s less glamorous. \n\nBuild up to the fun stuff. And then do it for fun and love.']
1ki25n5✺⭆SideProject✺⭆Reddit is a goldmine of startup ideas-and it blew my mind.✺⭆Every day I’d see posts like: \n•	“Why isn’t there a tool that does X?” \n•	“This app’s UX is awful, I wish someone would fix it.” \n•	“Does anyone know a service that solves Y?”\n\nAnd I kept thinking: These are literally startup-worthy signals. Just buried under layers of comments and chaos.\n\nSo I started building a tool that surfaces those signals-turning all that noise into a clean, usable feed of startup ideas.\n\nWe shared the early concept here a while ago and it got way more traction than we expected. That feedback helped us iterate fast-and now we’re at 100+ early signups.\n\nSome were bots or duplicates (filtered out with a quick fix), and we’re now building the MVP.\n\nStill figuring out: \n•	How to grow organically without triggering subreddit rules \n•	Which features truly help people spot valuable ideas \n•	And how to stay user-focused, not just feature-happy\n\nWould love to hear how others discovered their first 100 users-or what you’d want from a tool that turns Reddit noise into insight.✺⭆['I would not exactly call it a goldmine. It is more like a dump where someone rarely and accidentally flushes a ring with a rare gem along with other waste.', "Why isn't there a tool to tell me how many versions of ifound currently exist?"]
