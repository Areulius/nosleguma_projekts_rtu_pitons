1kja4zu✺⭆SaaS✺⭆Stop making stupid SaaS and start solving real niche problems✺⭆It's always SaaS Groundhog Day on this community...\n\nAnother post, another AI copywriting tool that requires a PhD to figure out. Or, I am being invited to the 12th Product Hunt clone that’s gone live this month.\n\nYou all are fighting for scraps in oversaturated markets while actual businesses with money are BEGGING for solutions to real problems.\n\nThe gold mine isn't in your generic tracker app, nobody will pay for. It's in those unsexy niches where companies are desperate enough to throw cash at anyone who understands their actual pain points.\n\nStop chasing the SaaS hype train and start solving problems people actually have. Your bank account will thank you.\n\nHere are ten ideas for niche SaaS products that one of you should start building today.\n\n# Regulated Industries\n\n* Idea: HIPAA-compliant messaging platform for small medical clinics.\n* Why it's smart: Healthcare providers require secure communication tools that comply with strict regulations. Offering a HIPAA-compliant messaging solution addresses this critical need, ensuring patient data privacy and facilitating efficient communication within clinics.\n\n# Niche B2B Vertical Tools\n\n* Idea: Scheduling and management software tailored for pet groomers.\n* Why it's smart: Generic scheduling tools often lack features specific to pet grooming businesses. A specialized platform can offer functionalities like pet profiles, vaccination tracking, and breed-specific grooming notes, directly catering to the unique needs of this niche market.\n\n# Internal Tools for Non-Tech Teams\n\n* Idea: Onboarding portals designed for HR departments.\n* Why it's smart: Human Resources teams frequently rely on outdated systems or spreadsheets for onboarding. A dedicated portal streamlines the process, ensuring consistency, compliance, and a better experience for new hires.\n\n# Data & Reporting Automation\n\n* Idea: Automated reporting tools that sync e-commerce analytics to spreadsheets.\n* Why it's smart: Manually compiling reports from platforms like Shopify is time-consuming and error-prone. Automating this process saves time, reduces mistakes, and provides real-time insights for better decision-making.\n\n# Boring Business Back-Office\n\n* Idea: Small chain store documentation management system.\n* Why it's smart: Small chain stores deal with extensive documentation, from training manuals to compliance forms. A centralized system ensures consistency across locations and simplifies updates, which is crucial for maintaining brand standards.\n\n# Event-Specific Tools\n\n* Idea: Management software for niche events like science fairs or hackathons.\n* Why it's smart: Such events have unique requirements, including participant registration, project submissions, and judging criteria. A tailored tool addresses these specific needs, enhancing the experience for organizers and participants.\n\n# Low-Code / No-Code Enablers\n\n* Idea: A workflow automation platform for specific industries, like legal or real estate.\n* Why it's smart: Professionals in these fields often lack technical expertise but need customized solutions. A low-code platform empowers them to build and modify workflows without coding, increasing efficiency and adaptability.\n\n# SaaS for Creators (Beyond Content Tools)\n\n* Idea: Income tracking and financial management tool for digital creators.\n* Why it's smart: Digital creators often juggle multiple income streams, making financial tracking complex. A dedicated tool simplifies income management, tax preparation, and financial planning, allowing artists to focus on their creative work.\n\n# Operations Software for Physical Businesses\n\n* Idea: Route planning and scheduling software for neighborhood service providers like pool cleaners.\n* Why it's smart: Mobile service businesses need efficient route planning to save time and fuel. A specialized tool optimizes schedules and routes, enhancing productivity and customer satisfaction.\n\n# APIs for Niche Data or Services\n\n* Idea: A sentiment analysis of local political campaigns, enabling real-time tracking of voter sentiment within specific districts or municipalities.\n* Why it works: Local campaigns often lack the resources for extensive polling or data analysis. This tool provides affordable, real-time insights into voter opinions by analyzing social media, local news, and community forums.\n\nNow, anyone who got this far, I know what you’re going to say. So I wrote an FAQ to address all the questions that the trolls will post in response.\n\n# FAQ\n\n# What if there are already competitors in the niche?\n\nGreat! Competitors validate market demand. Most niches aren't winner-take-all. Focus on specific pain points they're neglecting or target an underserved segment. Being second in a proven market often beats being first in an unproven one.\n\n# I tried XYZ idea before and it failed\n\nYes, new businesses do fail all the time. This isn't a surprise. But if you focus on a clear and obvious problem for a niche audience, you have a much better shot at success than building a SaaS tool with no obvious market. And be sure to validate your idea at each step.\n\n# I don't know anything about this industry. How can I build for it?\n\nInterview 5-10 potential customers. Join industry forums and attend trade shows. Consider partnering with someone who has domain expertise. The knowledge barrier actually protects you from generic competitors who won't put in the work.\n\n# How do I price a niche SaaS product?\n\nDon't underprice. Niche products often command premium rates because they solve specialized problems. Research what businesses currently spend on alternatives, then price based on value delivered, not just your costs. Many B2B niche products can justify $100 to $500+ monthly.\n\n# How do I find these niche opportunities?\n\nLook for industries still using spreadsheets or outdated software. Talk to friends in non-tech fields. Browse industry forums for recurring complaints. The best niches are hiding in plain sight, just invisible to founders fixated with posting on this community.\n\n# Won't these markets be too small?\n\nA focused $3M business serving a specific niche beats a failed unicorn attempt. Many niches are larger than they appear and can support multiple successful companies. Starting narrow doesn't mean staying narrow. You can always expand after establishing your foundation.\n\n# How do I market to these niche audiences?\n\nForget growth hacking. Go where your audience already gathers, like industry conferences, trade publications, and specialized communities. One industry influencer or respected customer case study often opens more doors than thousands spent on generic marketing.✺⭆['Thanks for the ideas ChatGPT.. and you of course are there to help the to-be-founders to market these ideas lol.', 'This is straight from Chagpt bro common.

1kipp0o✺⭆SoloDevelopment✺⭆Can you make a living as an indie dev without going viral?✺⭆I know it’s technically possible but I’m curious if there is anyone here that makes games full time without making a viral hit or having massive success. I’m not talking about millions of dollars, just a steady income to let you pay the bills, put food on the table and keep making games full time.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who’s doing it right now or has seen it done. What kind of games are you making? What kind of strategies, platforms or release schedules have worked for you?✺⭆['There are a lot of GDC talks on this topic. Study them. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/JmwbYl6f11c?si=DEzqhn_89NM3BqEo\n\nhttps://youtu.be/stxVBJem3Rs?si=tjdyyH9wVMxUg_RD\n\nhttps://youtu.be/YaUdstkv1RE?si=rXFfa6E3AgltrZT9', 'I\'ve been on teams before where at least one person was living off debt during development. It doesn\'t work. They just produce poor quality because they\'re stressed and under the gun. \n\nThe best indie devs don\'t need to be successful. It shouldn\'t be a gamble with your livelihood.\n\nYou get a lot of "jump and the net will appear" people in game dev. And it\'s not something I recommend. If you\'re looking for a living, do non-game dev first. The market is way more forgiving on general software dev because it\'s less glamorous. \n\nBuild up to the fun stuff. And then do it for fun and love.']
1ki25n5✺⭆SideProject✺⭆Reddit is a goldmine of startup ideas-and it blew my mind.✺⭆Every day I’d see posts like: \n•	“Why isn’t there a tool that does X?” \n•	“This app’s UX is awful, I wish someone would fix it.” \n•	“Does anyone know a service that solves Y?”\n\nAnd I kept thinking: These are literally startup-worthy signals. Just buried under layers of comments and chaos.\n\nSo I started building a tool that surfaces those signals-turning all that noise into a clean, usable feed of startup ideas.\n\nWe shared the early concept here a while ago and it got way more traction than we expected. That feedback helped us iterate fast-and now we’re at 100+ early signups.\n\nSome were bots or duplicates (filtered out with a quick fix), and we’re now building the MVP.\n\nStill figuring out: \n•	How to grow organically without triggering subreddit rules \n•	Which features truly help people spot valuable ideas \n•	And how to stay user-focused, not just feature-happy\n\nWould love to hear how others discovered their first 100 users-or what you’d want from a tool that turns Reddit noise into insight.✺⭆['I would not exactly call it a goldmine. It is more like a dump where someone rarely and accidentally flushes a ring with a rare gem along with other waste.', "Why isn't there a tool to tell me how many versions of ifound currently exist?"]
