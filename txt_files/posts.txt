1gpt0fz‚ú∫‚≠Ülearnprogramming‚ú∫‚≠ÜInsights from an ex-Googler who has taught 1000s of Engineers about DSA interviews‚ú∫‚≠ÜI interviewed Alvin Zablan, an ex-Google engineer who has taught thousands of people about data structures and algorithms. He's seen countless engineers pass and fail interviews at top tech companies, so his insights can make a big difference in your preparation.\n\nThe first thing Alvin recommended is that you need a learning roadmap. Many engineers start doing random problems without a direction or an understanding of underlying patterns. There's an infinite universe of possible DSA questions, so it's crucial to categorize the problems you're asked.\n\nWithin each category, ensure you have a deep understanding of various techniques. Alvin recommends starting with the basics like strings, arrays, and basic HashMap problems. These rarely give people a hard time, but you should master them before moving on.\n\nAfter that, here are the **5 core concepts** that will give you excellent coverage of many DSA problems:\n\n1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** The first building block of graph traversal.\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** The second building block of graph traversal.\n3. **Dynamic Programming:** Break down complex problems into simpler subproblems.\n4. **Recursive Backtracking:** Explore multiple solutions and backtrack when needed.\n5. **Two Pointer:** Efficiently iterate through arrays or linked lists.\n\nOne of the biggest things Alvin stressed is to focus on mastery of these concepts. The philosophy you should adopt is the 80/20 rule, where 20% of the input will give you 80% of the output. That means for these 20% **most common** ideas, you should go very deep.\n\nBe able to explain the solution in detail, identify alternate solutions, and explain what bugs would emerge with simple changes to the algorithm. If you do this, not only will you be much better prepared for interviews, but you'll also have tons of confidence for anything new you might see.\n\nA few other key takeaways:\n\n* **Learning comes before practice**: Leetcode is for practicing your DSA skills, not for learning them. Learning happens if you can read or watch a detailed explanation. You should feel empowered to watch and re-watch tutorials until you truly 'get it.'\n* **Practice mindfully:** Solve problems to solidify your understanding, not just for the sake of solving them. Instead of giving up on a problem after a few minutes of struggle, give yourself a hint by watching the first 30 seconds of the solution and then struggling more.\n\nHappy to answer questions or share my own perspective as a Staff Engineer in Big Tech in the comments :)\n\nEDIT: Alvin made his 10-hour crash course about Data Structures and Algorithms free here: [https://www.jointaro.com/course/crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms-concepts/](https://www.jointaro.com/course/crash-course-data-structures-and-algorithms-concepts/)‚ú∫‚≠Ü['>  Be able to explain the solution in detail, identify alternate solutions, and explain what bugs would emerge with simple changes to the algorithm. If you do this, not only will you be much better prepared for interviews, but you\'ll also have tons of confidence for anything new you might see. \n\nAs another ex-Googler (admittedly with less experience than Alvin) I really want to highlight this point. When I was interviewing candidates, so many of them would go completely silent during the interview. It was a much better sign when a candidate would take time as they\'re working to explain their thought process.\n\nSpecifically, I loved to see candidates say things like "I\'m going to start with a very simple solution that might not be the most efficient, or cover all edge cases" and then implement that. Then we could talk through different ways to make it more efficient, or to cover different edge cases.\n\nBeing able to speak about your solution was also really helpful if a candidate got a little stuck. They could say something like "I need to do a set union here, but I don\'t remember the exact syntax for it, is it okay if I just write `union(left, right)`?" For me, that sort of minor pseudo code was always fine. Being able to verbalize like that made me the interviewer comfortable that they really understood what was going on, even in moments that might have tripped up other candidates.\n\nThanks for writing this up, I think all the advice is spot on in my experience as well.', 'God I fucking hate the interview process']
1gr0pop‚ú∫‚≠ÜSaaS‚ú∫‚≠ÜAfter spending 6 months on a product that made me 0 dollars, I built a second one in 2 weeks and made my first magic wifi money. Here is my story.‚ú∫‚≠Ü# Previously on Indie Hacking Gone Wrong\n\nA first-time indie hacker starts a project, much bigger than he can handle: AI-based email summaries delivered to your inbox. With the grand promise of eventually fixing emails once and for all, assuming a magical place full of people unknowingly, yet eagerly waiting for his product, he spends \~6 months in total isolation, without validating his idea, all of his time devoted to developing this project.\n\nAfter many technical challenges, sleepless nights, and in result, wasting a huge amount of time, his magnum opus finally hits the markets. And then‚Ä¶\n\n<crickets>\n\n\nNothing happens. No trial users. No paid users. Only a few people check the website. Surprised as a Pikachu can get, our protagonist has no idea what to do and how to proceed. Wanting to share his story and what he learned from his failure, he posts a huge wall of text on Reddit‚Ä¶\n\n<cues intro music>\n\n\n# Brief intro\n\nHey again r/SaaS,\n\nA few of you might remember me from my previous post on this subreddit. My story got \~350k total views here and on a few other subreddits, \~1.6k visitors on my product‚Äôs website, resulting in 13 free users, truly great feedback, and a few friendships üñêÔ∏è. I didn‚Äôt expect such a great turnover at all, I am so thankful for everyone that spared some of their time reading it.\n\nI really love writing long-form content, and I am here once again for Part II. Not promoting anything. Just sharing a new part of my story, what I changed from my learning from my first failed project, and what happened since then.\n\nNow, story time.\n\n# The Reddit incident\n\nAt that point, I had zero paying users, zero trial users despite having a very generous trial plan, around 30 people per day checking the website. I was surely up for a slow start, but I was not getting anything. I barely have any marketing skills, so I had no idea how to better promote the product. Even if I could, people‚Äôs not signing up even for a trial is surely a bad sign. So, clearly it is not working, and I need to know what to fix? Having so little expectations of anything, just to vent a little bit, and get some pieces of feedback, I wrote something that turned out to be a huge wall of text about my story as a first-time indie hacker, and decided to post it the following day as it was already too late.\n\nThat day was my wife‚Äôs day off, so I wouldn‚Äôt have my computer with me; but since only a few people would respond anyway, I could do well enough on my mobile if needed. So, before we left home, I posted the story across a few different subreddits. A few hours passed, I checked my phone, and saw +22 notifications from Reddit. I remember thinking, ‚ÄúOkay, some people found my story interesting, that‚Äôs hella nice. I‚Äôll get back to them once I am at home later‚Äù Surely nothing is urgent.\n\nI didn‚Äôt know my phone doesn‚Äôt show more than 22-23 notifications from an app. So I assumed that was all the reaction I got. Only very late that night, almost 12 hours after my posts, I got to know what in fact happened.\n\nSo, I got back home around 11:00 PM. The plan is to have a quick look at what happened, take a shower, engage with people before I go to sleep around 2:00 AM. But, what happened in fact is that around 120K total views on Reddit, 3 or 4 people signing up for the trial, the website AND the web app crashing earlier the day. I basically have no audience anywhere and never had such a huge reaction in my life, so I do not know what to do, and cannot process what is happening. Barely can think straight. Need to steam off, so I take a quick shower, get back to my computer, and converse with people.\n\nThat night of my Reddit incident, talking with people, trying to reproduce and fix one bug (I failed, I still blame my server), and taking notes of their feedback took around 7 hours. At the time I went to sleep ‚Äì 06:48 AM (I know, bc I have a screenshot), the total views were over 200K, and five very nice people signed up for a trial.\n\nFor the first time in my life, many people read something I wrote. I didn‚Äôt filter anything, I just wrote what I did, and moreover, showed how I feel. Perhaps that resonated within the people of Reddit. But, it was something I didn‚Äôt experience before. Heck, the same story had gotten less than 50 views on X.\n\nFor me, that post had another goal: Writing a more ‚Äústructured‚Äù playbook for me and sharing it with others, outlining my mistakes, what they caused, and how I could do better the next time. I am by no means a successful indie hacker, on the contrary, I am a successful one at being terrible at it. That was kinda the whole point of the post.\n\nSo, how did that first product of mine, Summ, go from there? I got so much great feedback from people, and the number one feedback I got was this: They were rightfully concerned about their data privacy. I got into very deep conversations with a few people here, spent two weeks researching alternative ways to solve the issue, and the conclusion I came up with was there were no good ways to solve it without fundamentally changing how Summ worked, which would require me to write the whole web app from scratch. But even if I would, it wouldn‚Äôt completely solve the data privacy problem, and people still were not showing that level of interest in this new solution as well.\n\nEven if I wasn‚Äôt writing one single line of code for Summ, the mental stress and effort this all thing put me into was enormous. I still strongly believe that emails are the backbone of the internet, and they need to be fixed; but I did not have time, skills, and patience in me to keep working on Summ, so, while having 13 somehow active users, I decided to sunset Summ a few weeks ago.\n\nI was ready for a new chapter in my indie hacking life. After all, I learned so much from my past failures. I even made a list, something like a playbook of what NOT to do. Once you have something like that, you follow it to the letter, right?\n\n# Some lessons learned not so well\n\nJust to give a clearer context of what happened later, I think this is a good time to TL;DR the lessons I thought I had learned:\n\n1. You or your product is not an exception to fundamental principles.\n2. Always validate before you start. VALIDATION, VALIDATION, VALIDATION.\n3. Understand your target audience‚Äôs problems and pain points, only then think of a solution.\n4. Focus on building and selling only one feature at a time. Avoid everything else. No secondary feature will sell your product if your primary one doesn‚Äôt.\n5. Spend at least twice as much time marketing as you do building. You will not get users if they don‚Äôt know your product exists.\n6. If you don‚Äôt get enough users to keep going, nothing else matters. VALIDATION, VALIDATION, VALIDATION.\n\nThose do not suffice to explain what went wrong with Summ, and why it failed at the end; but the primary culprit was not asking for validation at all, and doing that would save me enormous time, that‚Äôs for certain.\n\nBack to the story: Now, I had known what I did wrong, basically what to avoid at all costs, so you don‚Äôt do them again the next time.\n\nWhat is validation, though? People joyously jumping over? People lining up to pay for your product? 10,000 people signing up for a waitlist? There are many forms of it, but I think that the ultimate form of validation is ‚ÄúMoney in your account.‚Äù Even having enough free users is not a good sign, if only few converts to paying users.\n\nBut, how do you validate an idea if your social circle is very small as mine is? You try to get in touch with strangers you do not know, ask for very little of their time, and see what they think of your idea, product, etc. This takes time, but definitely needed, Summ proved that for me.\n\nBut, I thought, perhaps there is a way to turn around the formula: What if your next tool needs a very short building time, so short that validating it pre-launch is a waste of time. You could ask for validation when in the market. My reasoning was this: If I have an idea to build around 2 weeks, but no more, why not to spend 1 week to validate it? How good would saving one week of your time do to you? So, why not build and launch it first, and only then ask for validation, especially if the ultimate form of it is ‚Äúmoney in your account‚Äù?\n\nI already knew this would not work for larger projects, as I learned after a painful experience I had with my first project; but could it work for a much smaller one?\n\nI am strongly convinced that one of the most important elements of entrepreneurship (no matter how large or small your scale is) is experimentation: Building a tool is an experiment on the world, marketing is an experiment on people‚Äôs minds. If anything can be an experiment, why not validation as well?\n\nSo, the goal was to find a small-scale idea that I could build within a few weeks, launch it as soon as possible, and only then ask for validation. If people pay for it ‚Äì you have ‚Äúmoney in your account‚Äù ‚Äì then it is validated. If not, the experiment is concluded to be a failure.\n\nOkay, then I knew how to do this, but not what to do, or in other words, what to build? So, this time I needed an idea that solves an actual problem, ideally in a business setting. Thinking about my FT positions, I remembered I really hated showing everything on my computer while screen sharing, especially while moving across different windows as a remote employee. So, I thought, I could build a desktop app that could hide some windows, info, etc. Surely, building a desktop app is not that hard in this great age of AI dev tools.\n\nI spent a few hours watching several tutorials on how to develop one, and this was probably the most depressing time I spent as a ‚Äúcoder‚Äù. Even the most basic concepts were unnecessarily complex, I would need a long time to grasp them, and building such an app would take definitely more than I wanted.\n\nBut, why not make it a browser extension? It might have its own challenges, but still a completely different experience for me and definitely a shorter building time. Seems to check all my boxes, so it could not go wrong this time.\n\n# A new challenger appears\n\nAt that point for the sake of experimentation, I had thrown my own not-to-do list out of the window, except for one rule: Building a product with only one core feature, no more. Do nothing else if you must, but do that one perfectly. If somehow you get enough users wanting you to build further secondary features, do that only then.\n\nSo, what would be my core feature? Obviously, hiding any element on a webpage. How would I do this perfectly, and more importantly, for whom would I do this? In a previous life, I pursued philosophy in academia, so it is well forged into my soul to conduct very thorough research to the point of making it some waste of time, meaning that it was time to do some actual research this time.\n\nPeople, especially remote workers were surely concerned about their privacy, wanting to hide their personal and sensitive information from others‚Äô eyes; but it was an eye-opening experience for me to see that such a tool would work great for content creators, streamers, and video editors: I never opened a video editor in my life, so I did not know how much time they spent on blurring and filtering out sensitive information during post-production. This tool could save their time definitely. Especially concerning streamers, adding a Safe Mode feature could work great ‚Äì turning on the Safe Mode would blur all tabs, and the streamer would disable it for the current page they are on when they want to. Furthermore, I learned that simply blurring information is not enough for protecting yourself: Deblurring tools exist, and it is not that hard to give them a try to reveal a user‚Äôs hidden info.\n\nI already knew that I should build a one-core-feature tool; but doing it perfectly would add lots of building time. But, this one, I suspect, everyone has to do.\n\nJust to give you a more concrete picture of the difference between two cases, this tool with one core feature would need selecting an element, and adding a blur filter on top of it, done. But, if I were to do it perfectly, I would need to add those sub-features as well:\n\n1. Safe mode + Disabling for the current page\n2. More filtering options than just blurring\n3. Drawing filters\n4. Auto-save for all filters\n\nBeing completely honest here, that one core feature does not take too much time. But, different filtering options and drawing filters, and having a proper UI; those took the most of my two-week building time. It was quite a smooth experience, other than my wrongly assuming I could not do it with React, and using Vanilla JS. Once the extension was completed, all remaining was to submit it to browser app stores, and simply wait until it got approved. Mozilla was the fastest one to approve, Chrome took around one week, but Microsoft two weeks for no reason. Knowing that Microsoft Edge support was not needed immediately, once my tool, [Blurs](https://www.blurs.app), got approval from Chrome and added to Chrome Web Store, it was finally time to launch and face the music.\n\n# Houston, we have a problem\n\nThis brings us to last week.\n\nWhat is my launch process? Well, surely, as this is my second time bringing a mind baby to the world and I am with some experience, I know what I am doing, right?\n\nDefinitely not. Randomly share your product on X, add it to a few free and low-effort directories, then have a ProductHunt launch. The end. This was basically it for me, more or less.\n\nBut, ProductHunt‚Ä¶ F\*\*\*\*ng ProductHunt. I hate you and love you so much.\n\nMy first ProductHunt launch was definitely a shitshow. For some reason, I could not postpone my launch, and I was four hours late to it, with no visuals prepared, with nothing. I got almost zero traffic from that, barely over 30 upvotes, nothing. Checking what others are launching on it has become a morning routine for me for almost three years now. Imagine how frustrated you would get after waiting for your first one for so long.\n\nBy then, I learned that anything that can go wrong might go wrong with a ProductHunt launch. Luckily, I already had my visuals prepared thanks to browser extension store applications, and all I needed was a first maker comment, and optionally an interactive demo. I also wanted to showcase how Blurs works on my landing page as well, so I checked a few alternatives for that, and after testing both Supademo and Arcade, I went with Arcade. The decision was arbitrary. I spent a few hours on the first maker comment, knowing that it is 80% of a ProductHunt launch, successful or not.\n\nI let a few people I know about before and on the launch day. Then something happened‚Ä¶\n\nFor some reason I still have no idea about, ProductHunt decided to feature Blurs on the homepage, which brings lots of traffic to its PH page, and thus to its webpage. Maybe they thought it was a cool product, maybe it was pure luck, maybe they rolled a dice and I got lucky, I do not know. All I knew was that it was quite cool.\n\nThis got the ball rolling, and Blurs got 153 upvotes on its ProductHunt launch day, resulting in a very nice rank #10 for the day. Some people definitely found it an interesting tool to support. Even more, it was on ProductHunt‚Äôs daily newsletter. All of this was super cool, but seeing my product on ProductHunt‚Äôs newsletter? That‚Äôs the coolest sh\*t ever happened to me as an indie hacker.\n\n# Nah, we cool\n\nFew months ago, a friend of mine brought a bottle of Jagermeister as a housewarming gift. I am a social drinker at best, and if I drink on my own, it means a special occasion, thus I wanted to wait to open it until one.\n\nTowards the end of my ProductHunt launch day, something else happened. Something magical. Something that made me crazy happy. Something that finally made me open the bottle.\n\nI made my first indie hacking dollar. The amount was very small, not even crossing LemonSqueezy‚Äôs minimum payout threshold. It was by no means life-changing, but the fact I made any is definitely one.\n\nMy spending (or wasting, depending on your perspective) 6 months on a product didn‚Äôt result in even one penny, but this second product of mine, the one that I had some idea of being actually useful, the one that I spent only a few weeks building, made my first magic wifi money.\n\nRemember the talk about validation? Blurs got validated by the market for sure. But how much validation is sufficient to continue working on a project? That, I have no idea. For now, this is not something worth bothering myself.\n\nThis was exactly seven days ago from today. Not a second sale yet, but that‚Äôs okay. Somehow, I feel like I am in the right general direction, but who knows? Blurs definitely needs some marketing, and more exposure, despite my having very little knowledge of them; but I have a few ideas that might turn out well.\n\nEven if they do not, even if Blurs doesn‚Äôt make a second sale ever, comparing how much time I spent on building both projects (6 months vs 2 weeks), I definitely did much better this time. So, this is already a huge win in my mind.\n\nSo, thank you for reading Part Two of my story. I know it is a very long wall of text, but I really like writing long-form content, and I very rarely get a chance to write on. If I get another story to share in this form, it‚Äôll surely be here; but for sharing how this indie hacking journey of mine going, random thoughts and shitposting, I hang out on X with the same handle, in case you are there as well.\n\nSo long, and thanks for all the fish.\n\n\- gdbuildsgd‚ú∫‚≠Ü['You should learn how to create a TLDR; ;)', "It sounds like you've learned some invaluable lessons along your journey!

1gs3pfs‚ú∫‚≠Üwebdev‚ú∫‚≠ÜThis is quite embarrassing to admin, but I never truly learned git‚ú∫‚≠ÜSo I am a self taught web dev, I started learning 5 years ago to make my "million dollar" app, which actually made a whopping -$20 (domain was kinda expensive lmao), then I never stopped making apps/services till I eventually figured it out. But I always worked alone, and I don't think that will ever change.\n\nMost of the time, I use git simply to push to a server through deployment services, and thats about it. Now that I think of it, most of my commits are completely vague nonsense, and I don't even know how to structure code in a way that would be team friendly, the only thing I truly follow is the MVC model.\n\nSo now, I am being forced to use git as more and more freelance projects fall into my lap, and I am absolutely lost to what to start with. Like I know most of the concepts for git, I know why people use it, and why would it be beneficial for me. Yet, I still feel as if I have no base to build on.\n\nI finally came around learning it, and I tried courses and whatnot, but everything they mention is stuff that I already know.\n\nIt's almost as if I know everything, but at the same time not?\n\nHow can I fix this?\n\nP.S I am the type of dev that wings everything and just learns enough to do whats needed, don't know if this necessary to mention but yeah.\n\nedit:\n\ntypo in the title: admit\*‚ú∫‚≠Ü['Honestly the beauty with git is that you only need to know like 5% to be good 90% of the time.\n\nWhen i mentored or had juniors, id create a git cheat sheet.

Latest updates have not been posted on this sub before. This is a VERY, VERY LONG and somewhat technical post.\n\n**Mood Spoiler:** >!honestly idk but it's definitely an interesting look into someone's life!<\n\n**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i_start_job_5_on_monday_12_mil_a_year_heres_my/)**: January 10, 2022**\n\nI am in IT. I have a fairly niche title that everybody wants right now. I have 5 full time jobs, 4 of which are fortune 500 companies. If I manage all 5 for a year, I will make around 1.2 million in 2022. I made 16 dollars an hour in 2016. I'm still struggling grasping the sheer amount of money dumping into my bank account.\n\nAt the start of 2021 I got a new job. It paid around 70k (105k to \~170k) more than I was making at my previous job. I had the inside scoop from a previous coworker, so I was able to name drop and negotiate effectively. I was tempted to keep both jobs, since due to covid both were fully remote. My fiance is incredibly risk averse, so she talked me out of it. As I got situated in my new position, I became increasingly set on getting a second job. I played video games from 8-4, and sat in meetings barely paying attention. I've probably done around 15 hours of real work since I started in January of last year. In April I opened my resume to the world and by June I bagged job 2 (82 bucks an hour). Holy crap! Two jobs! I was giddy with the money, terrified of meetings overlapping, and horrified if they found out about each other. As I settled in to job 2, I found the meetings to be tedious. There were around 4 hours of meetings each day for job 2. I suffered through them, agreeing to job 3 (having never stopped interviewing. I just made my salary expectations higher and waited for something to fall in my lap). My thought process was that job 3 (90 an hour corp to corp) would likely replace job 2, as job 1 is a laughable cake walk. However, since I am now in the position of power, I decided to try to flex it a bit. I told my project manager that the meetings were a waste of my time. They got nothing done, and they didn't contribute to my work at all. I now participate in an average of 45 minutes of meetings each week for job 2. Job 3 is also a cake walk - around 1.5 hours a week of meetings, probably 5 hours a week worth of work.\n\nI continue to field any job that will hear my salary expectations. I am now saying 95 an hour is my salary expectation. Another corp to corp gig comes around, and the hiring manager loves me. Once again being in the position of power, I am able to simply set my expectations with ZERO fear of the results - "Given the scope of the work, my salary expectation is 105 an hour". "The highest we can go is 100." "Nope." They gave me my request. They then tried to push back my start date a week. I told them "I had already gave my two weeks at my previous job, so they will need to pay me for the absent week". They hemmed and hawed, they tried to say no. I simply told them that I wouldn't work there then. They paid me 4200 dollars for a week that I didn't even sign in. I expected this job to fold quickly, as it's with a VERY prestigious company and there is quite a bit of spotlight on my role. It turns out that I haven't done fuck all since I started mid October. At 4200 dollars a week to go to a standup each morning to say I have nothing to do since \*October\*, job 4 is somehow an even bigger cake walk than job 1.\n\nOn Monday I start job 5. Initially having agreed to 115, I tried to press them for 127 an hour, but ended up at 120. This appears to be another job that I will just sort of expect to get fired from, but hopefully it turns into another easy 5k a week for doing jack shit.\n\nLet's talk about things that I think are working for me:\n\n1: Be fearless. After all, once you get job 2 your risk absolutely plummets. It is ingrained in you to be terrified of getting fired. That fear can fucking die when you move into your second role. The amount of relief of not having to worry about what your boss thinks of you, or how you accidentally overslept and that might piss off some clown in charge, it all fades. It's beyond freeing.\n\n2: Be willing to be fired. I have the luxury of having job 1 be a cake walk with incredible benefits. So, from there, who gives a fuck about getting fired from job x? I try to keep job 1 happy (in the future probably not saying things like "I am going to actively find a new job" lol) and don't really give a shit about the others. I try to do the absolute bare minimum to keep all the jobs, since replacing one is a pain, but any fear of getting fired just isn't there.\n\n3: Flex. Your. Power. Be willing to say "I can't make that meeting" or "This meeting is a waste of my time." People don't want to rock the boat. They don't want to do something that might be stupid. Use the fact that most people also want to do the bare minimum to get by. I have had zero pushback when I've asked meetings to be moved, or "Hey, I can't make the standup today".\n\n4: Fuck having to defend yourself. Just say "I can't make it". I have gotten zero pushback on this.\n\n5: Use your power position in not needing to listen about the job that is offering that paltry 65 an hour. Recruiters have a range. Demand the range. If it doesn't fit 10-15 bucks an hour more than your current job, tell them no. I EAGERLY accepted a role at 82 an hour 6 months ago. Christmas Eve I accepted a position for nearly 50% more than that. Flex. Your. Power. Job 2 takes the power out of your employers hands and plants it firmly in your own. Use it to climb, grow, and make your life what you want.\n\nI have paid off all my debt already, bought a second house, will have enough money to completely revamp both houses by the end of February, and plan on snowbirding from Florida to WV for the foreseeable future at the ripe age of 35. Since this is all debt free, maybe I will cut down to 2 jobs? Maybe I will just dump money into retirement (starting your own S-Corp is fucking powerful guys. Talk to a CPA). Maybe I don't really give a fuck? Because the world, for the first time in my life, is MY fucking oyster.\n\nI'm more than willing to answer any questions. Even though I have 4 active jobs right now I still play video games 4-5 hours a day. I have plenty of time. Hopefully this empowers someone to take the leap into this fucking¬†*incredibly*¬†positive lifestyle.\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\nCommenter: I LOVE THIS! But I‚Äôm curious‚Ä¶ do your jobs not ask for statuses on tasks? How do you get away without producing much?\n\n>**OOP:** I think most people think the bare minimum is much higher than it actually is. There's a lot of sighing, a lot of "ahh this roadblock", a lot of "I ran out of time this week".  \nThere's been a ton of times that even I have been like "There is no way they actually take this excuse" and they always do.\n\nCommenter: What tech stack you using?\n\n>**OOP:** I'm hesitant to give any real details in this vein, but fuck it. I'm a site reliability engineer. I advocate for automating system tasks, along with working towards identifying issues that cause outages or issues that will eventually cause an outage. I mostly work within the Azure cloud, as it's easiest to hide behind the cloud when I'm ignorant on a topic. I'm honestly an absolutely trash engineer, and I fail any interview that really digs into technical knowledge.\n\nCommenter: are you salary or contract?\n\n>**OOP:** 1 Fulltime, 1 w-2 contract, 3 corp to corp contracts.  \n(to another): None of them have non-compete. I don't think it applies, given the scope of work? I was sort of surprised that none of them had one.\n\nCommenter: Corp to Corp is new to me, where can I find jobs like this? Also, what do you put on LinkedIn or job history in your resume while working for multiple companies?\n\n>**OOP:** Most tech roles that are contracts will offer both W-2 or corp to corp. You just need to have your own corporation, insurance, etc. Costs about 1.5k to set up all in all.  \nI keep job 1 as my job history. I don't mention any of the other jobs.\n\nCommenter: Congrats on the money OP but there is a thin line we might not want to cross. You may think this is coming out of jealousy (sure, it is) but idk man, this sounds like ‚Äústealing‚Äù.\n\n>**OOP:** I apologize if I get animated here, but it's something I am very passionate about.  \nEvery single corporation you have ever worked at doesn't care about you. They will "steal" your time for as little as they can possibly pay for it. They will ignore every good thing you do, and say you don't get your bonus because of that one time you forgot to fill out your timesheet. Corporations are designed to fuck over the people that work for them as much as they can, stopping just before those people stop coming to work. Fuck this mindset.  \nI wouldn't advocate to do this to a mom and pop shop. I'm tempted here to list some of the companies I work for, but I won't because I think that WOULD be being Icarus. Suffice to say that I don't lose a fucking wink of sleep. They do it to people every single day and it's considered "good business". Fuck them.\n\nCommenter: How much is your net deposit on pay day? Asking as a Junior dev to motivate tf out of me‚Ä¶\n\n>**OOP:** 4800 a week pre tax, 4200 a week pre tax, 3600 a week pre tax, 4500 every 2 weeks after tax, 3250 every 2 weeks after tax and 401k max.\n\nCommenter: That sounds great, but I am just wondering how do you handle the on-call. The possibility of being on-call simultaneously for 5 different jobs sounds like a nightmare.\n\n>**OOP:** J1 has my on call 2 weeks every 13 months. I actually just got through my oncall and ignored all the calls because I didn't recognize the number. No issue from anyone on that front.  \nJ2 had me on call straight out of the gate, but I told them that it was unrealistic for me to be on call with the number of systems and familiarity you need to have (they have a VERY old, antiquated system). So I just am not on call at night anymore.  \nJ3 only needs to be up during business hours. So I am "On call" about 3 hours after I sign out for the day.  \nJ4 I was afraid of, but like I said above I have done literally (and I mean literally) nothing since mid October.  \nJ5 is more of an advocacy role I think. I will be surprised if I am an engineer that is on-call. I'm unsure about this one though.\n\n**Mini Update in** [Comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/comment/hx6du92/:) **February 16, 2024 (1 month later)**\n\nI'm pretty slammed with 5 jobs. I was in meetings all day except for 30 minutes yesterday. The goal is to make a bunch of money. If I can make a bunch of money and not slave away for 8 hours a day that would be ideal.\n\nAhh, keeping j1. It is the easiest, and the one that would probably never fire me. However, Resume management is a huge part of this IMO. I don't want to have some weird amount of time where I am "working two jobs" according to my resume. The titles at both of the new potential jobs are also very good. I don't know. I haven't decided yet.\n\nThe excitement does fade. I'm pretty used to the amount of money flowing now, and honestly it still manages to feel slow. lol\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/u0j8bf/5_jobs_the_update/) **1: April 10, 2022 (3 months later)**\n\nHey everyone. I've had lots of people ask for an update and I got notified that it's my 10 year cake day today, so I'm feeling inspired to write up a summary of my last 4 months.\n\nI still have all five jobs. I've gotten a promotion at one, a surprise extension at one, and berated for "not delivering anything at all" at one. When berated about a month ago, I simply yelled back that "my job is hard" and that "poor communication from management has pulled me in many directions" and I haven't heard anything about it since. I've stepped my game up slightly to hopefully eliminate these chats in the future.\n\nI have had several large deliverables that have been pretty stressful - I tend to heavily procrastinate (which is honestly probably why I am good at managing multiple things - I inflict this on myself constantly. Lol) and that has led to some overwhelming moments. Thoughts like "I should quit this job instead of deliver" came to me pretty often, but that's pride talking. Fuck pride. Fire me please daddy. So I've been continuing the trudge, trying to not allow the absence of good work and the looming concept of being let go get the better of me. I have a plan, I'm sticking to it.\n\nJob 5 turned into the biggest cake walk of all - I get paid about 20k a month for job 5, have a nice extension into August, and have done about 3 hours of work (probably about 8 hours including meetings) since I started. This one is not going to last forever, but my boss and I jive well, and I am serving the purpose they want me to serve, so everyone is happy.\n\nI'm still playing 2-6 hours of video games every day, averaging about about 15 hours of work *\[editor's note- OOP clarified he meant per week, not day.\]* I've started playing video games through meetings and paying even less attention than normal. This is honestly probably pushing things too far, and I'll need to limit myself a bit better.\n\nOnce again, I will be aggressive about answering reasonable questions (to the guy that asked if I would be a reference for him, I appreciate you shooting your shot but jfc), give advice, or whatever. Please recognize that I am not some grand pooh bah of employment though. I am a trash employee who kind of lucked into a vein of IT that people don't know how to control yet.\n\n* Icarus with 5 sets of wings\n\n***Some OOP's Comments:***\n\n**OOP:** I go into this pretty heavily in the other post, but yeah, debt is eliminated, bought a second house, rehabbed the first house, rehabbing the second house, bought a model S. I am going to start heavily contributing to a pension for my company next. There's just so. much. money.\n\nThere have been a huge number of quality of life adjustments, my wedding is coming up and has been paid for completely in cash, I paid for 6 people to fly to it, helped my younger brother out with some cash, I tip like 100% at every restaurant we go to. I'm absolutely being more frivolous than I should if I was trying to be as efficient as possible, but it's fun as shit and I get to make other people have a good time too. Life is good.\n\n*OOP's Job:*\n\n>There was another dude in the previous post that was an SRE \[site reliability engineer\] and he just flat called me a liar because his job was so demanding. I think being an SRE is a place where you can chill, or inflict a ton of positive change if that's what you're into. I think the real secret sauce is knowing how to be a shitty employee without anyone really catching on, rather than being an SRE specifically.\n\n*OOP's office set-up:*\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/PExxflI](https://imgur.com/a/PExxflI)\n\n>It's modified now a bit - I have a switch on the far right side with 4 computers attached to it and switch to a mouse/keyboard/monitor setup for whatever job I am doing work for. But that picture gives the main gist.\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/wl2mjt/part_3_its_not_all_butterflies_and_rainbows_an/) **2: August 10, 2022 (4 months later, 7 from OG post)**\n\n**Title:** Part 3 - It's not all butterflies and rainbows - An Icarus Story\n\nHey all. It's been 8 months since my original post which can be found¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i_start_job_5_on_monday_12_mil_a_year_heres_my/). My update post can be found¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/u0j8bf/5_jobs_the_update/), which was 4 months ago. *\[editor's note- OOP's math is off here, but that's probably because they started posting in January (1) and now are posting in August (8)\]*\n\nTo bring you, my beloved reader, up to speed here's a rundown. At the start of 2022 I had 5 jobs making an estimated 1.2Mil/Year (that estimate turned out to be bad. It was more like 960k). My update consisted of being wary about J2 being dissatisfied with me, J5 offering a dramatic contract extension, and the other jobs going mostly well.\n\nThere have been two main moments that I would like to share with the group, and both of them include being let go.\n\nJ2 I initially hated, due to their excessive meetings. As my beloved reader may recall, I pushed them aggressively about how those meetings were a waste, and they were significantly cut down. J2 was relaxed and I didn't do much at all. My leadership changed at about the 6 month mark, and immediately my new supervisor smelled the foul stench of a dogshit employee. At first I thought he was simply grumpy in general but it turned out he wasn't interested in continuing my contract. He scheduled a meeting about 3 months into being my boss, and explained that he was frustrated that I don't deliver anything. I yelled back that my job is hard, and didn't hear much from him over the next 3 weeks. With no real warning, the contract company I was working through emailed me and told me I was no longer an employee with them, pack your laptop, yada yada. While you could say his comment about me not delivering was a warning, there was no actual talk of "You aren't delivering well enough, if you don't improve you will be let go". If this was my only job I would be angry and poor.\n\nJ5. I truly miss job 5. My boss used me as a scalpel occasionally after I met my initial goals. We got along amazingly well. I barely worked. She knew I barely worked. I got the weird crazy shit done that she needed a consultant to handle that an employee might get in trouble for. Truly an amazing gig. She said my contract would extend into 2023. Insert frowny face here. The economic downturn led to the money drying up for all consultants at this company (of which there were many), and I got about 1 week of notice (in the middle of a 3 week vacation I was on) that my job would effectively not be available when I got back. My boss reached out, apologized for the abruptness of it all, and we said our farewells. If this was my only job I would be angry and poor.\n\nThis, to me, is why we do what we do. In once instance I got fired for being a shit employee that deserved to get fired. In the other my boss is exceedingly pleased with our working relationship but the company chose to protect profits over giving a shit what the impact was to the individual. In both cases the company chose to utilize a safety net to protect itself. It has the luxury of shedding employees in order to protect the plans or financials of itself as an institution. OE allows individuals to develop their own safety net. It provides a solid "You fuck on me? I fuck on you" relationship with these employers that truly don't care (due to the nature of capitalism, profit focusing, and corporate mindset). It levels the playing field considerably. For those of you reading that suffer from a deranged moral compass that wants to bootlick for these abhorrent corporations that don't give a single flying fuck about you, I want you to consider the above two lessons. Very different perspectives, same exact result.\n\nAs an overall life update, house 1 renovation is completely done (paid in cash), my Tesla has been purchased and received (paid in cash), I took a lavish vacation overseas and paid for 10 people to go (paid in points for travel, cash for the airbnbs), house renovation two is set to be paid for and will hopefully begin at the start of this year. In essence I have shrunk down about 10 years worth of goals to about 10 months. With the 3 current jobs I make just under 600k, and I start a new job 4 this week.\n\nAs always, I am pretty much willing to answer any question that doesn't DOX my ass. I am a huge advocate for this mechanism of changing your lifestyle and your lifegoal timelines and I hope to convince at least 1 more person to take the leap.\n\n-Icarus (with slightly melted wings)\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\nCommenter: how the heck can you take a 3 week vacation from 5 jobs all at once\n\n>**OOP:** I had been fired from j2 already. The other 3 are contract spots, so I just don't get paid. J1 I took vacation days.\n\n*The companies:*\n\n>I have a LinkedIn that stops at current j1. I'm pretty sure someone from j5 saw my j1 still posted on LinkedIn and called HR saying they thought I was working multiple gigs. I explained the general concept of what I was doing sort of, giving them enough info to appease them but not enough to burn my lifestyle down. J1 HR was appeased, but it definitely made me rethink my current thought on LinkedIn. Mine is still active and listing j1 though.\n\n***OOP's Comments on original BORU:***\n\nCommenter: "the company chose to protect profits over giving a shit what the impact was to the individual." Really dude? Really?\n\n>**OOP:** To be clear, this wasn't a "the employer is bad because they did this". The point I meant to convey is simply the reality of the situation. The company WILL protect itself, and employees are some of the easiest things to shed. I'm advocating for the value of not having all of your eggs in one basket, not the evils of corporations protecting themselves.\n\n*OOP's accountant/CPA:*\n\n>I said this in the other thread too - the CPA didn't even blink when I was describing the situation.\n\nCommenter: Good for this person. That is a really sweet set up. It's still hard to not feel salty when I work 40+ hours a week as a teacher and am paid less than a tenth of what he earns in a year (at 600,000).\n\n>**OOP:** I have a soft spot for teachers because of this. The people we SHOULD pay get absolutely fucked. I am paying one of my teacher friends 100k a year to learn how to do what I do, and hopefully take over a job or two in the near term. My other teacher friend wants to stick around, so I just buy everything for him when we are out and about.  \nMy heart goes out to you guys. You're super fucked right now. Hopefully it gets better. You are appreciated.\n\nCommenter: I've seen some humblebrags in my life, but this takes the cake. I suspect you're going to write a book or become a financial personal trainer or some shit.\n\nYou don't even know the story of Icarus.\n\n>**OOP:** I call myself Icarus because someone in the first thread called me that. Icarus is the boy who made wax wings (to escape jail I think?). He flew too close to the sun, focusing on having a blast flying, having too much confidence in his creation, and his wings melted. He plummeted to his death. My response to that nay-sayer was that I have many sets of wings because of this, but keeping the name is more of a troll of that one dude.  \nI have no plans on leading people down silly paths and making money off of other peoples backs. I truly love pilfering money from large corporations. I'll stick to that, thanks. I have been tempted to write a book though. People have seemed to enjoy my straight forward approach and aggressive honesty about myself. I doubt I will follow through with it though.\n\n# New Updates to this sub\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/10wgt3k/part_4_icarus_has_wings_that_melt_but_apparently/) **3: February 7, 2023 (6 months later, 13 from OG post)**\n\nHey guys, this is the fourth iteration of my path of OE. I started in about June of 2021 and have been updating semi frequently since January of 2022. A bunch of you have asked for more updates, so here we are.\n\nFor clarity, I will refer to all jobs by the number that they were received. As an example, J2 will be referred always as J2, though I am no longer employed there.\n\nJ1 - J1 still going great - Just got 50k dumped into my bank account as a bonus. Just got vested in all ways that I can get vested. The meetings are starting to increase due to team size and responsibility increases, but it would be pretty hard to beat the benefits/vacation/pay all in one, so I will probably keep it even if I have to drop down to 2 jobs. Idk. What the hell do I care? I'm a huge advocate for being dynamic, so we will see.\n\nJ2 - Fired. They figured out I sucked after about 10 months. I did, in fact, suck. Oh well.\n\nJ3 - Fired. The work load was pretty easy, but getting that work load done was misery. So. Many. Requests. I'm talking 7 individual requests to 6 different teams to get an alert created. Absolute ass. Sad that I sucked for my super cool boss, but that's really the only negative. Lasted for about 1 year.\n\nJ4 - J4 going strong and I hope it never goes away. I do absolutely fucking nothing. I have 4 30 minute meetings on my calendar. I go to 1.5 of them. I am "on-call", but I have been called a grand total of 3 times, and those wake up calls are literally the ONLY thing I have contributed. 245k so far to do damn nearly literally zero things. Hilarious. I fucking love J4.\n\nJ5 - As you may recall, I loved J5. My boss and I got along marvelously. Due to the economic downturn I had to say goodbye, but she called me and I'm back! Whoop whoop! Start date is in a few weeks. Hell yeah these wings are apparently unmelting back to wings as a plummet to the earth. Rad.\n\nJ6 - J6 sucked so bad. I was there for about 2 months. 120/h. They were just unsatisfyable. My go to is to impress the shit out of them up front and fade away into the ether. Well these guys just refused to be impressed. Whatever. They paid me 40k to be frustrated and annoyed for 2 months. Worth.\n\nJ7 - This job just started, and I was brought on as a large group to another company to facilitate some SRE focused changes. Good. Fucking. Lord. This team is a joke. A sham. A terror to all things "agile". Leadership is nonexistent, we have no access, access requests get denied, stories get deleted and are called "confusing" but that confusion isn't explained or corrected. I fully expect this job to just completely collapse. Who knows? Who cares.\n\nThat's the rundown. If you're keeping track, that's effectively 4 jobs currently. I was down to 2 for a few months. It was honestly kind of relaxing. I'm still trudging along, just raking in money. My financial advisor loves planning shit with me, as I am pretty open to whatever, I'm young, and I've got a fuckton of money coming in. Between my wife and I we made about 880k last year. On that note...\n\nHoly fucking fuckkkkk taxes. Bruh. I'm about to send a god damn house worth of money to the IRS. My CPA is still working on it, but the fed is gonna get like 200k from my ass. Obviously worth, but holy cow. I think I paid like 23k in fed taxes for the 2020 year. Crazy shit. With the 2 w2 jobs and my wifes w2 job, we have a good amount in taxes paid already, but I'm still gonna write a 130k check or some nonsense. Brutal. As part of my life advice column, don't forget to save for taxes if you have your own corp. I was living the high life with 5 jobs. I could save up 200k in about 2 months if I needed to, but jobs don't stick around forever. Don't count on them. Just put it in a decent savings account and keep that shit.\n\nLife in General\n\nLife is pretty good. I have a solid retirement plan set up. My arbitrary figure right now is to retire at 55 with a yearly stipend of about 230k until death with a before/after taxes wombo. Houses are sitting pretty, with a much needed facelift to one, and the other will start in the summer. I hired a buddy to learn how to be an engineer since I've figured out how to set myself up and I like to help people. Dude is making 100k a year being a fucking rookie. Hilarious. I also get a nice tax reprieve from bringing him on as 1099, so that's nice. The hope is for him to kind of take over J7 if they ever get their own giant foot out of their own giant ass. Otherwise I don't have much to update. I haven't really learned anything new; my perspectives/recommendations are static from my first post. I think it's a good way to go about this whole OE thing. Chase that J4 man. Whoooo boy that job is fucking rad as hell.\n\nAs always, I will aggressively answer questions people have. Don't nag me though guys. Read through the comments of the first post before you ping me or I will ignore you.\n\n***One of OOP's Comment:***\n\nCommenter: How‚Äôs your physical health? Do you have time to get some exercises? Does your sleep schedule get impacted? Plan on having kids?\n\n>**OOP:** Physical health is ok. I've been pretty shitty the last 5 years, but was incredibly active before that. Working towards losing the belly that has built up now. I've been super into fasting recently. It's working pretty well. Sports 2-3 times a week, trying to get at least 30 mins of walking in each day. It's a process.  \nMy sleep schedule is awesome. I wake up at 8:58 for my first meeting sometimes, about 3/4 times I just skip it and get the extra 30 mins of z's.  \nKids are no bueno. I have plenty of nieces and nephews that I can rain money down on and I like my time being mine.\n\n[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/10wgt3k/comment/j85ikwj/) to OOP's long reply to someone saying it's fake\n\n**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/1f1rnzm/the_final_chapter_the_closure_of_oe_from_5_jobs/) **4: August 26, 2024 (1.5 years later, 1 year 8 months from OG post)**\n\n**Title:** The final chapter - The closure of OE. From 5 jobs with an expectation of 1.2 mil a year to one job.\n\nHey everyone. Some of you may remember my original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i\_start\_job\_5\_on\_monday\_12\_mil\_a\_year\_heres\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/overemployed/comments/s12c8l/i_start_job_5_on_monday_12_mil_a_year_heres_my/)\n\nI still get requests to update, and given that my J4 project was officially announced as closing at the end of September, I figured today was a great day to write out my experience, what I did with my money, and some closing remarks to fully close out this wild ride.\n\nThis year, I have had two jobs. My original J1 is still my J1. I was promoted to principal and overall the amount of work I have to complete has significantly increased. While I don't care about companies at all and believe that pilfering as much money from them for as little work as possible is not only morally right but absolutely appropriate given they do the inverse to us every day, I do care very much about the individual people I interact with daily. There are multiple juniors on my team that require substantial effort, which I am very happy to help coach them and assist in their career growth and navigation. My teams' overall responsibility has also been much better defined and therefore it's been harder to hide in plain sight. I like the company, I like the work, and I like the team. I've never been proud of a place I've worked at before, and I believe that J1 has earned that pride and the trust I have placed on them by allowing it to become my sole job.\n\nJ2 (J4 from my original post) has gotten pretty gross. We were a team split in half by FTEs and contractors (10 in total). We got a new manager early in the year who simply has no appreciation for how terrible the on-call is. We were all sharing the primary/secondary responsibility, so I was on-call once every 2.5 months. That week is usually hell. You will get called on average 2.3 times a night. There were a few times where I worked for \~30 hours straight. Absolutely brutal. One of my fellow contractors left for a different team and the new manager made the rest of the contractors be solely responsible for on-call. So now I am on-call once a month, which is honestly so bad I thought about leaving just because of this, even though we basically don't do any other work. It simply wasn't sustainable keeping J1 happy while getting absolutely ass-blasted 7 days out of 28. Well, they have decided to end our contract at the end of September and expect the FTEs to now do that work. They are a good crew. I truly pity where their work life is headed.\n\nI am still passively looking for a new j2, but honestly right now I feel a fairly immense amount of relief. Unless something falls in my lap I will be working the single job until the market recovers. Having to actually earn a job through solid interviewing is so annoying. lol. Below I will go over earnings, how I've benefited, where I fucked up, and where I succeeded. Hopefully it's interesting to you, or even something to learn from.\n\nRough gross earnings:\n\n2022: 360k\n\n2023: 730k\n\n2024 (estimated year end): 450k\n\nNet worth at the start: \~90k\n\nNet worth current: \~1 million\n\n**Purchases that improve my life on a long term basis:**\n\n* Significant improvements to primary residence: 120k\n* Hot tub: 15k\n* Second home in the area of both of our families: 50k down. Rental income hasn't started on this yet, but something just fell in our lap for 6 months out of the year for 2k/month. This will pay for a majority of the financial impact this creates. 15 year/2.2% rate. We stay here \~2 months of the year.\n\n**Significant improvements to primary residence: 120k**\n\n* The top of the list has to be wine. I have spent too much money on wine. No real estimate here. <30k\n* Model S Plaid. Writing a check for 100k for a car was... interesting, but I had wanted a Tesla for many years. I had no plans to buy the plaid, however they pushed back my delivery date by 3 months 3 separate times and had the plaid available immediately. What's another 45k?\n* My wife has been a large benefactor of me raking in the dough. Roughly 30k total on jewelry, bags, etc.\n* My wedding. We got married in Europe and paid for \~8 people to come that wouldn't have been able to afford it. We paid for lodging, a majority of food, and a majority of the wine. Amazingly, all of that totaled about 30k. I would do this again in a heartbeat. It was fun as fuck, cheaper than paying for only the venue/lodging in the states, and we got a Europe trip out of it.\n* Paid for myself and my 4 brothers to go to a Bills game with great seats. My eldest brother has been a lifelong Bills fan and is a cheap piece of shit, so this was a great way to spend some time and spread the love. \~10k\n\n**Where I fucked up financially:**\n\n* In my efforts to get a financial planner I stumbled on a company. This company verbally told me they were a fiduciary, talked me into the ol' classic health insurance as a retirement vehicle scam, and it cost me about 50k. Now, in Mr. salesman's defense, I think if I continued making \~750k a year for 20 years this would actually be a good plan, and through my own idiocy and ego I figured that would be ezpz. After all, getting new jobs was easy as FUCK. Surely that would continue?\n* The car goes here too. It's fun as fuck to drive. It's smooth, quiet, has all kinds of things I can set to improve my own personal experience, the self driving on the freeway is mostly incredible (boy have there been a couple scary moments though), etc. However, 150k on a car is pretty god damn \*\[Editor's note- TW, ableist language\]\*>!retarded.!<\n\n**Things I have done to improve other peoples lives:**\n\n* As noted before, I have a soft spot for teachers. I have paid for all meals (home or away) for my teacher friends when I am present. I have tried to elevate their ability to come out and have fun without worrying about the impact to their financial lives. As a past poor, I was very familiar with the reluctance to do something fun because of cost. Fuck that. Come have a good time. Don't thank me. Thank J4 and call me Robin Hood.\n* A long time friend (and teacher) wanted to break into tech, so I hired him. He knew fuck-all about anything technology related, and I did my best to get his feet wet. The goal was for him to take over one of the jobs, but that never really panned out and I basically paid him to read/take certs/experiment. Paid him 50/hour fulltime for about 9 months. \~80k. He now has a tech job doing basic DBA shit for \~85k/year. Roughly double his previous salary, he works from home, etc etc etc. I'm super glad this plan panned out.\n* While my mother in law was building a house, she stayed in house number 2 rent and utility free. This allowed her to get some of the "wants" for her house with the extra income without worry about rent.\n* My youngest brother is having some serious problems with his ex wife and their shared son. I'm definitely throwing my weight around to bully his ex in order to either lose custody, inflict shared custody, or some other mechanism to help improve my nephew and my brothers' existence. I've paid for several lawyers, several PI efforts, etc. \~20k\n\nThat's it. That's the sum total of 3 years of being OE. It's mostly been fun. I've learned a ton, mostly about how to manage people and expectations. My favorite moments have definitely been being able to tell people that should be told to fuck off, to actually fuck off.\n\nAs always, I am pretty open to any questions.\n\n***Some of OOP's Comments:***\n\nCommenter: Other than real estate you didn't mention any additional portfolio investments.

That bonus should be consistent in the near future.\n\nJ2 - \~75/H Very shitty electric company in the north east. Deprecated system. Pretty tedious. Fired after almost a year.\n\nJ3 - \~90/H Large healthcare company. Boss wanted to hire me full time after about 6 months, but some personal stuff got in the way for him and he was MIA for about 4 months. When he came back, he wasn't impressed (I wouldn't be either). Contract killed after about 14 months.\n\nJ4 - \~105/H Premium contracting company. Contract dies at the end of Sept. \~3 years total. Somewhere around 610k pilfered.\n\nJ5 - \~120/H. The big fast food burger joint. They killed all temp contractors when the economy looked fishy. Got fired during my wedding trip. lmao. This one made me sad, as my boss and I jived super well and this was damn near a free 5k a week. Killed after \~6 months\n\nJ6 - \~110/H. Large financial company. They churned me and burned me. Was there to do a technical analysis of their SRE program. Completed. Was there for \~1 month.\n\nJ7 - \~120/H. Large financial company. I could NOT make these people happy. Did the same actions that made J5 love me and they were beyond disappointed. No idea what they were looking for, but it wasn't me. There for about \~2 months.\n\nJ8 - \~95/H. Large shipping company. I told my manager that I didn't suggest an improvement to an implementation that I didn't fully understand yet and she just deleted my ass. I guess she wanted me to be hyper aggressive about my opinion without fully understanding the system.

1gut82a‚ú∫‚≠Ülearnprogramming‚ú∫‚≠ÜIf you had to learn again from 0, what would you do?‚ú∫‚≠ÜHey,\n\nSo I want to learn full stack development. I know a bit of php/laravel/nodejs/react/vue but I prefer to learn again from 0.\n\nI want to learn React + TS for the front end, and I'm not sure about the backend - if I should go with Express/Next + TS or something else.\n\nFor the DB - I prefer MySQL or Postgres.\n\nWhere should I learn from?‚ú∫‚≠Ü['Honestly, if I could take all the time I\'ve wasted in my life picking the perfect language and apply that to getting really good at a single language, no matter what it is, I\'d be leagues ahead of where I am now. It took me far to long to realize that all the discussion about things like "TS replacing JS" or "Python is too slow for \\[insert problem here\\]" are all problems that do not apply to 99% of problems and people, and doubly so for anyone in the learning phase (well we\'re all constantly in the "learning phase", so a better label would be "beginner" phase)\n\n  \nAnyone is welcome to disagree with me here, but for arguments sake, lets pretend we have two bright eyed and bush tailed CS students in their first year who want to get hired after graduating. Student A did a bunch of projects in a bunch of different stacks while jumping around between languages until finally settling on TS to focus on in his Junior year, and proceeds to learn as much as he can to become hire-able after graduating. Student B is a jokester and spends 4 years outside his coursework studying and making things in SPL (the joke *Shakespeare Programming Language* ), not something any company is looking for at all, and Student B only ventured outside that single language when necessary (ya know, the usual suspects, SQL, HTML, etc etc)\n\nIf I was hiring freshers for a Typescript role, I\'m already expecting them to come in pretty damn useless. No offense, but that\'s the expectation, and what you study doesn\'t always translate to what you do on the job. Now I\'m looking at Student A and Student B, from an "experience" level you would assume that Student A is the obvious pick (and HR to be fair would probably also agree, but ideally they have less input than "me" who is on the tech team...) But, if asked who I believe is a better programmer, I would very likely say Student B every single time, and there\'s a very real chance that I would suggest that he be hired, because Student B likely has much more in depth knowledge about "programming". Additionally, if I  saw someone do some crazy shit with something as dumb as SPL, I know that they likely ran into problems that required some actual thought and cleverness to be able to work around that were caused entirely due to the language choice being suboptimal, and that shows the devs actual engineering prowess if they are able to make something work in spite of those obstacles.\n\nTangentially related, we all know Javascript sucks and it\'s slow. Yet Vampire Survivors was made by some mad man in Javascript, idk what that dudes got going on in that mind to have convinced him to do that.... but he now has millions of dollars more than I do.... If you saw the article on HackerNews about huge Zendesk vulnerability found by some 15 year old, he used Javascript as well. Go and ask a game dev community if you should use Javascript, or a hacking community if you should use it, they won\'t recommend it....   \n  \n  \nWe all want to choose the right tool for the job of course, but often we focus too much on that and end up not learning or building anything. I upgraded my GPU last week, and for the life of me could not find the right screw driver.... The "correct" thing to do was probably to go out and get the exact tool I needed... Instead I used a knife and and moved on with my life, and when I logged into Discord to chat with my buddies no one at all cared that I solved my problem using a tool that was technically less optimal.\n\n  \nTL;DR: In the learning stage I would throw a dart at a dartboard with a piece of paper listing every popular language on it, and study just build things using only that language, no matter how suboptimal. And then branch out when necessary (stuff like HTML, CSS, SQL, yadayada)', 'Spend more time doing the thing and less time thinking about doing the thing, preparing to do the thing, talking about doing the thing, and just generally avoiding all of the procrastination traps that are everything but doing the thing.']

1gvkfvu‚ú∫‚≠Üpassive_income‚ú∫‚≠ÜI still make around 4k passive profit a month from Instagram, but it took a lot...‚ú∫‚≠ÜIn high school I was mindlessly scrolling through Instagram. I had no big plans‚Äîjust an idea to create a random account where I could post funny memes and cool conspiracy theories. The account wasn‚Äôt anything serious, just a place for me to kill time and share some laughs with friends. I ended up creating it and spam posting on it without any structure or care.\n\nTo my surprise, the account grew. It wasn‚Äôt an overnight explosion, but followers trickled in steadily. By the end of a few months, I had thousands of followers and a stead flow of people liking and commenting on my posts. One day, out of the blue, I got a direct message from someone asking if I was willing to sell the account. I didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing, but the money they offered seemed too good to pass up. I sold it.\n\nThat transaction flipped a switch in my head. Social media wasn‚Äôt just a platform for sharing random thoughts‚Äîit was a business opportunity. I started thinking about why my first account worked and began experimenting with others. I didn't know what I was doing at the time, but I juggled creating content, engaging with followers, and managing now more than one account... all while keeping up with schoolwork.\n\nYears later, I found myself running a small network‚Äîcomedy and model pages. This was when I began charging for story/ad promos and even affiliate marketing here and there. Companies were actually reaching out to me on at least one account every other day. It started becoming a lot to handle and I was lucky enough to find someone who had just started having the same passion for Instagram as I did back in high school. I made him a manager of the accounts and he helped out tremendously. This allowed me to focus more on strategy and reach out for more business, while he generated content and engaged with followers.\n\nFast forward years later again, I do less Instagram but I still barely lift a finger. The pages continue to grow due to always outsourcing quality people. Income rolls in from story promotions, affiliate marketing deals, and even the occasional sale/flipping of an account. What started as a random, high-school hobby has turned into a passive-income stream. And while I‚Äôve ventured into other projects, I‚Äôll always remember that first account‚Äîand how one impulsive sale changed everything.‚ú∫‚≠Ü['4k a month would set me up where I live.', 'Curious, is this original content / influencer stuff, or is a theme page with content stolen from elsewhere?']
1gwm8k7‚ú∫‚≠ÜStartup_Ideas‚ú∫‚≠ÜWe went from 0 users to 1600+ users after 80 days of effort and $0 spent.‚ú∫‚≠ÜI'll tell you exactly how we did it, but first you should know:\n\n**the bar is a lot lower than you think.**\n\n* Most people aren't following a clear process for building and launching their products.\n* Most people quit trying after 2-5 months.\n* Most people don't have a plan.\n\nYou don't need to work 70 hour weeks and be an expert to succeed. You just need to not make the common mistakes and stick around for a bit longer. That's enough.\n\n**Now, here's exactly how we went from 0 users and 0 traffic to 1600+ users with 80 days of effort and $0 spent:**\n\nStep 1 - Foundation:\n\n* You shouldn't build any random idea. Your idea needs to be validated or else it won't resonate.\n* We used the Reddit to determine market demand for a few different ideas.\n* We found one idea that indicated market demand and that we felt excited about.\n* So we started building right? Nope.\n* We reached out to potential users about the idea we had and kindly asked if they would help us by answering 6-7 questions. We found these people on Reddit and X.\n* Their answers indicated that people had the problem we were looking to solve and that they were interested in the product we would build, and even be ready to pay for it if it was good.\n* Great. Now we build.\n\nStep 2 - Building:\n\n* This is the easy part. We knew what we should focus on from the feedback so we let that guide our building.\n* We built fast. 30-45 days for the MVP.\n* We made sure that our MVP actually solved the problem we had identified.\n* That's it. Time to market this MVP and see if we can get some users.\n\nStep 3 - Marketing:\n\n* First we set a clear goal. We wanted as much feedback as possible so we were going to need active users. Let's say 20 active users, that was our goal.\n* Then we selected 2 marketing channels we believed in. What marketing channel you select depends on where your potential users are and who they are. For us it was Reddit and X.\n* Then we set daily volume targets. For example, post 50 replies on X on relevant posts.\n* So we had our daily targets, meaning we knew exactly what to do every day. We thought it would be reasonable to expect that we can hit our goal of 20 active users in 2 weeks.\n* Then we just executed our marketing plan. It was easy, because we knew what to do every day. No questions.\n* 10 days later we were at 70+ users. We had hit our goal.\n* The feedback on our MVP was good so we got the green light to build the full product. Let‚Äôs go!\n\nStep 4 - Build again:\n\n* This time we had much better feedback.\n* We removed everything that was bad.\n* Added some good things.\n* And made sure we were still focused on solving the core problem.\n* Voila, we had a pretty awesome product at this point that users actually want.\n* Time for the official launch.\n\nStep 5 - The launch\n\n* Since our product is made for founders, Product Hunt was the perfect place for us to launch.\n* We prepared a demo of the product, wrote a launch post, said our prayers, and then we launched.\n* During the launch, we tried to drive as much traffic to our Product Hunt page as we could.\n* This meant creating a lot of content on X and Reddit.\n* It was a close race for the top 5 spots. Our small team of 2 brothers vs the large VC backed companies.\n* In the end we claimed the 4th spot on product of the day with 500+ upvotes. Success!\n* You can find the launch post here:¬†[https://www.producthunt.com/products/buildpad#buildpad](https://www.producthunt.com/products/buildpad#buildpad)\n\nStep 6 - Iterate\n\n* At this point we had over 1k users and had gotten our first paying customers too.\n* Now it was just about iteration.\n* Collect feedback > improve the product > market more > collect feedback ‚Ä¶\n* This is what we did to get to 40+ paying customers and 1600+ users.\n\nBut how did we know that these are the steps we should take to get there? How did we come up with this plan? The truth is,¬†**we stole it.**\n\nLet me explain myself.\n\nEarlier this year we failed hard. We spent months building a product that people didn't want. We tried everything to make it work (including spending $1k on ads), but we weren't able to turn it into a success.\n\nIt was really weird because we thought we had something good. The product made sense to us.\n\nFinally, we came to a point of sober thought. We had wasted months on a bad product. That sucked, but at least there were some lessons to be learned.\n\nWhen reflecting on what had gone wrong, it became clear.¬†**We had made the same mistakes that 95% of entrepreneurs make.**\n\nWe didn't follow a clear process. We spent our time on the wrong things. We didn't have a plan. There were a lot of mistakes and we kept seeing other people make them too.\n\nSo what if we build a product that solves that problem?\n\nA business building platform for entrepreneurs. The idea spoke to us deeply. We feel your struggles. We know how much it sucks to spend months building something, only to find out that no one wants it.\n\n**The product we built was meant for you and us.**\n\nNow to the cool part.\n\nWe used the product we built to get help building the product we built. Confusing? Let me explain:\n\nThe process I outlined above that got us our first 1600+ users wasn't us just freestyling. It was a carefully crafted process by Buildpad.\n\nWe started building Buildpad and as we did we used it at the same time to guide ourselves.¬†**In a way, Buildpad built Buildpad.**\n\nSuper meta, I know.\n\nBut that's what happened. And if you‚Äôre tired of building failed products, maybe give Buildpad a chance?\n\nProbably don't build another Buildpad though. My head starts spinning when I think about the meta of that.\n\n**But you can build something you feel passionate about and that people will pay you for.**¬†Or you can import your existing project and get help in getting that off the ground.\n\nOnce you've gotten your first payments and things are looking good for your business, perhaps you will consider giving us some feedback so we can make Buildpad even better.\n\nThis was a long post but it's something close to my heart. I hope you could learn something from our failures and our successes. And if you think Buildpad might be for you I'll leave a¬†[link.](https://buildpad.io/?ref=Reddit)\n\nI'm happy to offer my input in the comments if you have any questions.‚ú∫‚≠Ü['Thank you for sharing this.

I was doing okay but Sarah, a 37-year-old single mom, was juggling long hours and struggling to make ends meet. Bills kept piling up, and she felt like she was missing out on her kids‚Äô milestones.\n\nSix months ago, everything changed for her. She started promoting products she genuinely loved online. At first, it wasn‚Äôt easy‚Äîher videos barely got any views‚Äîbut she stayed consistent. \n\nFast forward a few months, and Sarah is now earning enough to leave her job, work from home, and finally attend her son‚Äôs soccer games.\n\nInspired by her journey, I decided to give it a shot too. Honestly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting much‚Äîeven an extra $500 a month felt like a win.  \n\nI didn't have the courage to talk on camera so I pointed my phone towards the product and started going Live 1 hour a day everyday.\n\nMy first two weeks felt awkward‚ÄîI was talking to an empty audience. But after learning from Sarah, I started seeing results. \n\nBy the third week, I got my first sale. From there, I figured out what worked and focused on improving. Now after 3 months of struggling, I‚Äôm earning between $2K and $5K a week consistently.\n\nIt‚Äôs not that much compared to some of you guys in here but it gives me the Freedom I always dreamed about. \n\nThe biggest lesson I‚Äôve learned? Every side hustle has potential if you‚Äôre willing to put in the time and effort. \n\nIt won‚Äôt always be smooth sailing, but the rewards are worth it.

1h0hn69‚ú∫‚≠Üconfession‚ú∫‚≠ÜI lied on my resume and the company that made an offer noticed....‚ú∫‚≠ÜI often fudge on how much I know of a thing. Maybe I worked with the software for a few weeks 3 years ago and used if just fine. They want expert level - I say I'm expert. I get the job and all I do is login, pull data, and log out. Less than I did 3 years ago. (UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM)\n\n99% of the time, as a contractor, I don't even do what they hired me for. I do a job that's beneath me. Here's what they do: Let's call them a fake name of "ABC Fargo" or "XYZ Bank America"\n\n* "ABC Fargo" company has a need for someone to create spreadsheets and process maps documenting a network topology.\n* They've had flakes in the role before - technical people who have no interpersonal skills and no business acumen, they work slow, don't understand the big picture, they don't keep people updated, etc. Maybe paying them $45/hr\n* So they hire me, an IT PROJECT MANAGER with a background 20+ years ago as a Data Network Engineer. Paying me $90/hr giving me the title of Applications Program Manager with a fancy job description with a bunch of shit I won't be doing, but ONE LINE in there that says I need to know how to document a network.\n* They figure they will aim high, pay high, just so they can be sure to get someone that can work well with other departments to gather the information, keep everything on schedule, and not drop out of sight, and do clean efficient work.\n* They don't care about my career and that this job is a step backwards, and when I go to get my next job as a Project or Program Manager, it makes me look bad if I say what I was REALLY doing.\n* They figure the pay is so high, I'm working from home, by the time I figure it out, I'll stay for the money - which I do. But my skills don't grow.\n\nSo yeah, I lie on my resume. Yeah I did extensive and complication project management for ABC Fargo for a year with budget, and tollgates, and scrums, and project plans, and clearing roadblocks. No way I'm going to say I just did spreadsheets and visio diagrams day in and day out for a whole year. This has happened on the last 6 contracts I have worked. They lie, I lie. We're even.\n\nSo I keep the fancy job description, I make up project accomplishments. Everything on there I know how to do, it's just not 100% honest.\n\nSo this time, I was finding it hard to find another role since my last contract completed April 2024. So I started fudging the dates so it looked like I did less contracting and stayed places a little longer. Sometimes contracting make you look flakey, but the money is GOOD!\n\nSoon as I changed up the dates, I got interview. Literally the next day after I started using the fudged dates. In my experience, that initial resume never seems to make it to HR - they look at the APPLICATION. I never lie on the application. Dates and titles are correct. I leave the job duty stuff though- they can't verify that. I've never been called on it until last week. People are often incompetent and it usually works in my favor. They're not paying much attention in how they do their jobs.\n\nI'm posting now because it's all complete and I started yesterday. Here's how it went down:\n\n* One of the recruiters for the agency was getting on my nerves calling me all day asking for information he could have just put it all in an email at the end of the day. He wanted to to a mock interview and I told him to take a hike, I'm old as fuck and don't need interview help. I think he got offended and decided to try and trip me up. He has never called or emailed me since then - his boss does. (I have an interview to contract for "EFG Sachs"\n* I have worked for this agency before at "XYZ Chaser Banker" in 2023. So they only need to verify the last contract I had after 2023 right? Nope. Somehow they are verifying EVERYTHING all over again.\n* I get an email from the HR/Background Check person: "You resume says this, but your application says this." I was like... Oh shit. It's finally caught up with me. It was a Friday afternoon, so I let it lay and took time to figure it out the weekend. I was prepared to lose the offer, so that made it easy to be confident about my response. Which was plainly and simply:\n\n>*"I recently had my resume professionally rewritten and it looks like I didn't double-check the dates. Everything on the application is correct and verifiable."*\n\nNo apology, no long-winded explanation. They accepted that and everything moved forward with them verifying. Whether they thought I was lying, I don't care. I got an email a few days later: "Background check complete."\n\nAll of a sudden, last Friday, I get an email: "Background check reopened." (gaslighting language, right?)  \nI was like... what is it now? I know the application was correct. Maybe they escalated to a manager about the resume and don't want to take a chance and upset their client "MNO Sachs". Because if "MNO" wants to take me permanent as an employee, they will do their own verification and the agency would be on the hook.\n\nTurns out, two of my old positions could not be verified - 1 wasn't answering and the other had sold and merged with another firm. So I sent them W2s for those two roles. See? That's why I don't lie on the application. SIDE NOTE: They wanted me to either send pay stubs or W2s or give them access to my taxes. If they got access to my taxes, they'd see the times I was working for two companies at the same time! When I worked for them and "ABC Fargo" remote, I also worked remote for another company remote. It was the tail end of COVID and I needed to make up for the times I had no contract. But I wasn't doing the work I was hired for, I was doing dumb work that wasn't challenging, so I worked two 8-5s at once - succeeding at both.\n\nSo use caution when showing them your taxes - they get to see EVERYTHING that's not their business. The IRS sends your transcripts directly to them!!! Total invasion of privacy.\n\nSo I won out on the application verification and started work yesterday (2 days in the office 3 at home - which leaves me room to do another contract, as I expect I have been lied to on this one as well). I've been out of work since April and today is my last unemployment filing - There's only $57.65 left of my claim.\n\n99% of the time, you won't get caught. But be prepared for that one time. I'm 50+ and this is the first time I ever got called on it, and I firmly believe I was targeted because I told the dude to chill. I've even lied about a degree out of frustration and it got me the interview. If I can interview, I'll get an offer.\n\nDo what you have to do to get that interview - don't take it too far and lie completely - fudge the dates and the titles and the duties. Don't straight out lie about working somewhere you didn't, or put duties you have no idea how to perform. Everything on my resume I can do.\n\n**TIPS**\n\n* If it's been a while, look at some YouTube training to get back up to speed or be able to discuss intelligently. Jot down keywords and definitions on your printed job description.\n* Always print out the JD and take notes on it - and have cliff notes as well. Include buzz words like business partners, team members.\n* Google Interview buzzwords and jot them down on the JD or on sticky notes somewhere you can glance at them during your video interview.\n* Ace the interview by acting as though you already work for the company, you're just going to be working with a different department. Introduce yourself, ask them about how you can help, what they need you to do,. Say we and our and us and shit like that. Trick them into it. Use their names (jot them down doofus - I'm bad at names too).\n   * "You know, James mentioned earlier that he'd had a hard time getting the last person in the role to respond to emails. I understand what that can mean to you being able to complete your part of the work. I am mindful that my part affects someone else's work. But if you aren't getting what you need, please let me know, and I hope I can do the same. I value my team and don't mind having a tough conversation and hitting the reset button. Tell me, Sarah (manager), what are you most proud about when it comes to your team?"\n   * "Mark, you work closely with this role and you shared what you would need from me if I were to join the team (see how I did that?). What are some things you don't want to see? (They LOVE this! They'll say: "Not double-checking the reports, not responding in time for weekly reports, not admitting when something is not understood, etc.")\n   * Just be relaxed and conduct yourself like you're in a conference call to work on a special project for a company you already work for. Tell them about you, ask about them, ask about the work. It will make you seem like part of the team, not some nervous weirdo acting like you're from Mars.\n   * Oh - one last thing. "If I don't know something, I'll say I don't know, but I can find out and get back to you by end of business. Or let's set up a meeting and find out together and come back and let the team know" No one should ever just say I don't know and leave it at that. They were asking me some word and acronym definitions, and on one of them I was like: "I know about the subject, but I may not know the formal terms you're using, so let me give you my best guess. Risk control is different from risk mitigation in this way: "Blah, blah... is that what you were looking for? If I were on the team and someone asked me that, I'd give my best answer and tell them I'd check it out more and follow up by a specific time." I don't know all the answers, but I know how to find them - that's the key.\n\nWell, I know it's a novel, but I hope it helps...\n\nUPDATE: People are DMing me asking about my career path and how I chose it.\n\n* I just started with a job and based on what I liked most, I grew that part and sought a job doing more of what I liked. In 1994 I worked as a staffing manager getting people temporary jobs - making $8.75/hr and placing people making $10+. We had to test them on software. A lot of people were great but didn't know the software, so I trained them on the side without permission and wrote some procedures/cheat sheet they could take on the job - they all got offered perm jobs - just needed a chance. I liked training, so I went after a job training and eventually got one. I lied on my resume to say I did training as a regular part of my job - a little fudge.\n* I was training network engineers on software, then graduated to training how to engineer a piece of equipment - I went from $18,200 to $35k/yr with no degree. Then I learned how much engineers made and since I could train someone how to engineer, I took a job as a network engineer because of the money. When I was a network engineer, I worked with project managers a lot.\n* So, I looked for jobs project managing network projects. I had never done project management as a role, but I had seen it done over and over. So I lied on my resume and said that I had done project management. I then studied project management and got certificates and then got a Jr. Project Management job.\n* September 11th hit and I was laid off. I created a shitty web site to advertise my training that I developed and became self employed. The training was for people who had gotten jobs but didn't know how to use software. I volunteer at an after school program that tutors elementary kids and they have a computer lab. The founder let me use it on the weekends. Which is when working people can come in to train. The city sent about 400 people over the course of a year into 2002.\n* Long story short (I am capable) people kept asking me to do a web site for them. So I taught myself web development and coding. I already knew database/SQL and command line from my training and engineering roles.\n* Web sites got easier for people to do themselves with Wix and more small businesses shifted to free pages on Facebook. Originally, Facebook did not allow businesses. So as my 15 year web business died, I saw a technical writer job in 2017 at a bank and became a technical writer - having written documentation in one form or another all my previous roles. I wrote policies and procedure documentation for everything and often came in contact with risk, compliance, audit. You have to keep your eyes open and not be that dumb person that only knows their own job and likes saying "I don't know, that's not my department."\n* From 2017 to now I have accepted roles with the most money ($75-90)/hr that I can get hired for. I have been Project Manager and Program Manager for IT and Risk, I have been Documentation Manager - I pursue Enterprise IT roles because IT pays more than Operations.\n\nThe job I started a couple days ago bounces me back down to Technical Writer, but in the job description and interview I learned this is a new department. This means I will have an opportunity in the next year to be back in Program management. I'm contract with a lot of experience, so my pay is the same as my IT and I work remote 3 days a week. (I prefer full remote)\n\nThere are so many lies about job descriptions, I don't chase some pie in the sky career. I need money. I am 54 years on come June and have had great experiences but mostly terrible job experiences - I am still in touch with my Instructor and Network Engineering pals (co-workers and students) from 1997-2001 - best jobs I've ever had. Nowadays 80% is co-worker drama/politics and 20% is actual work. Show me the quan, Jerry McGuire! :)‚ú∫‚≠Ü['Came here for the confession, left with career advice. Damn.', "The tips work.

RIP my inbox, unfortunately I can't respond to everyone and I've repeated myself a couple times already so I'll just highlight the most common responses here. These are my opinions feel free to disagree.  \n  \n**Knowledge Requisites**  \nGetting a degree will certainly help you get your foot into the door in this field but it is not a golden ticket into entry level cyber security jobs. Cyber security exists as a field because IT and networking was built for the purposes of convenience and not for security. In order to understand cyber security fundamentals and concepts you must understand IT and networking at a high to advanced level. I mean how can you secure a bank if you don't know where the vault is or how it works? There's not really schooling that teaches that, you need to get hands on experience whether in a self-designed homelab or in the field of IT. Taking a cyber bootcamp or a couple udemy/coursera courses is not going to cut it you really need to understand fundamental IT concepts and get your hands dirty. You might know people who got opportunities like that but they are the exception not the rule.  \n  \n**Degrees**  \nIf you are an undergrad studying computer science and minoring in cyber/information security is the ideal pathway on my opinion. This way you'll learn programming, networking, IT and security fundamentals all at once. This also depends on your school so be sure to make sure your curriculum tackles all those things. Majoring in cybersecurity is alright as well just be sure the curriculum includes programming and networking courses. This is in addition to getting hands on experience in the field or on your own time as I mentioned above.  \n  \nIf you want to pursue a graduate degree my strongest recommendation is to have your employer or someone else pay for it. A Master's degree in cyber security means nothing without the prerequisite experience, I know because I have one and I only did it because it was paid for. Not to say that you won't learn anything but most people in this field value experience over degrees 10 times out of 10. A Master's degree will help you enter higher levels of management but you need experience to get to that level, right?  \n  \n**Certs**  \nSecurity+, Network+ are the entry level certifications for this fieldb to demonstrate security and networking knowledge. These two certifications without experience will not get you an interview and if it does, be prepared to walk into a nightmare of a job. Other certifications are the CEH and Pentest+ which will help on the offensive side of things but also help train your mind on security practices. Coupling these certs with some hands on training like hackthebox and tryhackme will help you get she e really great hands on experience. Unfortunately you need to demonstrate this experience with either a job or a nice github profile.  \n  \nCISSP is the golden grail of certs in this field(even though it shouldn't be). It is highly respected and gets you past resume filters. If you have no experience do not study for or attempt a CISSP. Firstly you won't be granted one without 4-5 years experience and secondly no one will hire you.  \n\n\nOSCP is the golden grail for offensive security, but it is not for the faint of heart. This certification is extremely difficult and not entry level at all, do not attempt this without understanding IT fundamentals.\n\nTo recap, entry level certifications are helpful but you still need the requisite experience for them to be of value.\n\n**The Field**  \nLot of questions like what is the day to day, and what do you do?   \nThe answer is that it depends. Cybersecurity isn't a single job it is a very broad field. Most domains are technical in nature, but fields like risk and compliance are a bit less technical. SOC analyst is what I would recommend for anyone starting out. A SOC analyst triages security alerts/events to identify if a security incident has taken place. This is a great starting point because it gives exposure to a lot of areas of the field of cybersecurity like Incident Response, Forensics, SIEM engineering, and the like. You also see a lot of attacks which gives you some insight into offensive security and defensive strategies as well. There are many more domains and areas so you really have to do your research and find out what catches your interest.\n\n**Summary**\n\nGet hands-on IT experience, get some schooling(free preferred), take advantage of internships, and get some entry level certs to position yourself to start a career in cybersecurity. IF you're doing it for the money it's not likely to work out for you, sorry we're really good ad identifying BS.\n\n‚ú∫‚≠Ü["You know how to make a plot in excel, that's why you make more.", 'I am making $80K as a sysadmin doing mainly Exchange management, M365 management and Solarwinds Orion management.

1hm19wu‚ú∫‚≠ÜEntrepreneur‚ú∫‚≠Ü18yo who started with Minecraft, now running a $4K MRR SaaS - Here's my entire journey (no BS)‚ú∫‚≠ÜHey everyone!\n\nFirst time posting here. I wanted to share something real with you all. I'm 18, running a SaaS business with $4K MRR, and I want to tell you how I got here. Not to brag - seriously - but to show other young people that age is just a number, and we shouldn't let anyone tell us otherwise.\n\n## The Minecraft Years (Where it all started)\n\nThis might sound crazy, but Minecraft literally changed my life. At 13, while other kids were just playing, I was obsessed with coding plugins. Every. Single. Night. Looking back, it was probably a bit much (sorry, mom!), but man, it taught me so much.\n\nYou know what's wild? I keep seeing successful tech people who started with Minecraft. It makes sense though - running a Minecraft server is basically running a mini-business:\n- You need to manage moderation (customer support)\n- Build a community (marketing)\n- Work with other devs (team management)\n- Keep players happy (user retention)\n\n## The Coding Journey\n\nThat Minecraft obsession? It gave me this crazy problem-solving mindset. Everyone's bashing video games these days, but let's be real - gaming can literally launch your career if you approach it right.\n\nI'm now a fullstack freelance developer. When I tell people my age, they usually don't believe it. But here's the thing - starting early with something you're passionate about is like a cheat code for life.\n\n## Building My First SaaS (The Reality Check)\n\nSo, I built my SaaS in 3 weeks (yeah, I know, pretty fast). But then I had this "oh crap" moment: "Wait... I can code, but how the hell do I get customers? Do I even know how to market this thing?"\n\nBig reality check. \n\nInstead of panicking, I went full nerd mode on marketing books. Here's what I learned: Never limit yourself to what you already know. Your technical skills are just the beginning.\n\n## The Marketing Hustle\n\nYou know what's funny? The whole idea started in a coffee shop. I was helping someone with their homework, and suddenly it hit me - the real problem wasn't with the students, it was with the entire educational system.\n\nSo I started investigating the schools' side of things. Man, that was a reality check. Getting through to decision-makers in education is TOUGH. These aren't your typical SaaS customers - they move slow, they're careful with change, and they have complex approval processes.\n\nBut instead of going for the hard sell, I tried something different. I booked a meeting with one school administrator. Just to listen. Turned out to be the best decision ever. Schools were drowning in administrative work that could easily be automated.\n\nMy approach shifted completely. Started super small. One school. Made sure every single feature solved a real problem they had. When it worked, they became my best case study.\n\nWord spread in the education community. Other administrators started reaching out. Turns out schools talk to each other way more than I thought. Each new client helped refine the product further.\n\nThe business model clicked naturally - charging per student made sense to everyone. Schools get it, it scales with their size, and it's predictable for their budgets. That's how we reached ‚Ç¨4K MRR. Not by aggressive marketing, but by solving a real problem and letting the education community do the talking.\n\n## The Customer-Obsessed Phase\n\nInstead of going crazy with more marketing, I went ALL IN on making sure my first customer had the best experience possible. I:\n- Reached out personally\n- Collaborated on features\n- Gave them 3 months free\n\nCrazy? Maybe. But it worked. Not only did they stay, they started referring other customers.\n\n## Real Talk\n\nLook, I know this might sound like one of those "success stories" that make you roll your eyes. But I'm just a kid who:\n- Coded way too much Minecraft\n- Refused to believe age was a limit\n- Worked his ass off\n- Got lucky sometimes\n- Failed a bunch\n- Kept going anyway\n\nIf you take anything from this post: Don't let anyone tell you you're too young, too inexperienced, or that you should "wait until you're older." That's BS.\n\nJust start building. Start learning. Start doing.\n\n## What‚Äôs Next ?\nSince you guys seemed interested - I'm actually working on some cool stuff:\n\nContent-wise: If you found this helpful, I'm planning to share:\n* My exact technical stack breakdown\n* How I handle pricing (made so many mistakes here lol)\n* The complete guide of my outreach strategy\n* My daily routine and productivity system\n\nLet me know in the comments what you'd want me to cover first! I'll prioritize based on what's most useful to you guys.\n\nAlso working on detailed guides about specific parts of my journey (especially the Minecraft to SaaS transition since many asked).\n\nNot sure if it's useful, but happy to do a proper breakdown of any of these topics if there's interest!\n\nHappy to answer any questions in the comments - and yes, I'll actually respond. Not going anywhere!‚ú∫‚≠Ü['Would like to hear about pricing and all the mistakes you made in your journey.', 'I actually came upon your post looking for something completely different. I have a Synology nas and figured I could run a server with my kid for his switch console. I think realms is overkill.\n\nYour post me thinking that I‚Äôd like him to get into the minecraft coding journey. Any tips from your personal experience? I‚Äôd like to think about how to guide him as a father and the best places to gain information for what you learned.']
1hvi7l4‚ú∫‚≠ÜEntrepreneurs‚ú∫‚≠ÜI tested Reddit content marketing for a year got insane (6 figures $) results‚ú∫‚≠ÜSo I've been on this god forsaken platform for 15 years, ever since I'm a pimple-faced shit-eating teenager. Back in 2009, Reddit's got nothing but memes and cat pictures. For better or worse, times a changed.\n\nHere's the truth: Reddit is the best platform for business owners to test new offers, it‚Äôs the easiest way to reach hundreds and thousands of impressions for free.\n\nUnlike social media, Reddit operates without the unpredictable, black-box algorithms that runs the other platforms. Instead of chasing elusive virality, you can connect directly with niche communities, talk to your customers directly to get real actionable feedback. Let‚Äôs put all that aside for now, and I‚Äôll walk you through exactly how to find your first client on Reddit.\n\nI'll walk you step by step on how to stop being a lurker and start posting like a pro on this platform, where average well performing post will get you 100K+ plus impressions and hundreds of leads.\n\nBut you need to know how and where to write engaging content that people loves to read first:\n\n1. Find the relevant subreddit with your target audience via tools like gummy search.\n2. Spend one to two weeks visiting the subreddit every day. Sort by ‚ÄúNew‚Äù, and look for patterns in posts, usually people will post about the same things.\n3. Spend all of your time on perfecting the post title, be punchy and follow similar formats BUT be unique. This is one chance to make your offer stand out.\n4. DO NOT sell in the post content, keep it very short. Tell a story or speak your truth.\n5. Reply between posts, use sarcasm and be funny.\n\nOK, so how do you use Reddit as a lead-gen machine?\n\nUse Reddit as the top of the funnel, work in keywords that are relevant to your product or services. Don‚Äôt forget to add links to your profile, this is how people will find out more about you and your offer. I would directly add any buy links and social media links here if you have any.\n\nDon‚Äôt be afraid to delete posts that are not working, and make sure you don‚Äôt stack too many similar posts together. People WILL check your post history (it‚Äôs usually the first thing they do) and they‚Äôll dismiss you if your post history seems spammy.\n\nI would sprinkle in non business types of posts throughout, what are your interests? There‚Äôs most likely already a subreddit for that and just comment/post in it occasionally. I recommend 1 business post for every 3-4 interest posts would be a good ratio.\n\nMy goal is to test one new tactic per quarter and reuse the ones that already works. You should try these out and make them your own.\n\nStrategy breakdown\n\nSpend **30 days** exploring and consuming content in target subreddits.\n\nThen, Post weekly to engage your audience, allow **additional 30-60** days of progress:\n\n1. **Automoderator deleting your post:** Check the automod comment, make sure you aren‚Äôt using banned keywords.\n2. **Moderators deleting your post (rules):** Check the deletion reason, usually because you‚Äôve broke some rule or people being jerks reporting your content. Either way, bend the knee and try again.\n3. **No engagement (test post time, post title):** Try different post times, sort by top post in a subreddit for the week and look at when they were posted. Then spend time iterating on the post title, a catchy title is really important.\n4. **Downvotes or negative comments (test post content):** This step is key: refine your posts, tell better stories, stay patient, and engage in the comments. Use all negative signal as learning.\n5. **Viral 150K+ post with hundreds of comments:** You should get here within 90s days if you iterated and tested everything above.\n\nGoogle‚ù§Ô∏è¬†Reddit\n\nI'm an avid hockey fan and my team is the Toronto Maple Leafs, if you search for one of our player (last name Matthews) on Google, you'll see a picture of his mug as the top result, but something is off.\n\nSome genius recently went viral on Reddit (in r/leafs) with a photoshopped image of him with fake hair.\n\nGoogle placed it front and centre on the results page (for real, just search "matthews"). The Reddit post with 1.5K upvotes is a meme titled ‚ÄúAuston Matthews has returned from Europe after receiving treatment for his undisclosed upper-body issue‚Äù.\n\nThis confirms that Reddit is great for SERP results and a well performing post can get your brand to the top of Google search results with any keyword (in the post title).\n\nI‚Äôm actively exploring ways to leverage this to help product companies market their products and get boosted on Google search results. It‚Äôs super powerful.\n\n# But does Reddit ACTUALLY sell? The answer is YES.\n\nLet me tell you the story of how I came across a comment late 2023 while looking up how to make a custom engagement ring. I search Google for ‚Äújeweller recommendation canada reddit‚Äù, the post was the second result on the first SERP. After reading a few comments, I decided to reach out to the blacksmith. A few month later I got the ring in the mail and used it to propose to my girlfriend, we couldn‚Äôt be happier.\n\n$5,000+ purchase decision made based on:\n\n* A top Google result\n* Reddit comments and review, validating the seller\n\nBy this point you HAVE to purposefully provide a bad experience for me to look for an alternative. Reddit + Google search results + Community review = WIN\n\nOK but what actual results do you have to show for all this?\n\nCheck my post history. I've got multiple near top voted posts of all time in this sub, and those posts got me hundreds of leads and booked dozens of calls with prospects. I ended up closing multiple clients last year directly from those posts I made.\n\nSo how do I start?\n\nFor the next 90 days, just post about what you do, where you want to go, how you going to achieve it. It won't take you a long time trust me I've been there.‚ú∫‚≠Ü["I like Reddit a great deal more than doom scrolling on social media. There just seems to be less self absorbed pretentious posturing and faking the good life on here. There is real interaction on topics and I feel like there is a .ore literate connection with people. I once joked about how Instagram is Twitter for people who can't read and Twitter is Instagram for people who don't or won't. Reddit is the opposite of all that. It's far more legitimately social than most social media. All the moderation keeps things on topic and somehow it all works out like old Bulletin boards of the pre internet days."]
1hvq8x2‚ú∫‚≠ÜMeditation‚ú∫‚≠ÜMeditation can be seen as a video game. ‚ú∫‚≠Ü**Welcome to Mara Invaders.** ([Instruction manual included!](https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/booklets/practical-insight-meditation_mahasi)) You find yourself at the exosphere of Planet Buddha on the brink of an alien invasion, needing to construct the ENLGTND planetary defense grid so the planet can become impenetrable against further bombardments. However, you need to build this while also defending against the alien forces. The waves of attacks will get harder and harder. You will need more specific weapons against particular enemy types and must deploy them quicker and more accurately, and with each wave, you will be punished more severely for increasingly minor errors. And throughout your play through, you will also encounter boss enemies with very complex movesets that, if you are not careful or patient enough, will make you ragequit.\n\nSo let‚Äôs break down this analogy piece by piece. The defense grid we are constructing is our endgoal of having a purified mind. A complete newcomer will struggle with basic gameplay mechanics since he‚Äôs never played before. He might be enthralled in a thought for five minutes on average. But with enough practice, those time intervals will go lower and lower, from five minutes, to two minutes, to one minutes, and eventually to such an extent that one will be capable of noting objects coming into awareness on a split-second basis, popping them like balloons in a well constructed Bloons Tower Defense setup. Eventually, even the mental production of words is put aside as the player is able to use their weapons so efficiently and accurately that the older models, initially helpful, are now too clunky to keep up with the demands of further levels. In place of concept, bare knowing of all objects is attained.\n\nThe different alien ship types can be seen as different categories of thoughts (planning, fantasizing, thinking, arguing), emotions, or sense objects (random noises, pain from sitting, you name it) that are to be noted as quickly and accurately as possible. And the boss enemies are thus complex sensations (addictions, urges, powerful emotions, attachments) that require earnest work to break apart into smaller component objects that, after noting and letting them come, be, and go, have the potential (the chance of the item dropping isn‚Äôt always a hundred percent!) to help us understand what they really are and break us from their spell.\n\nAfter playing this game long enough, you will get an idea of what thought types occupy your mind the most and deprive you of the most attention towards the meditation object. You can thus set the intention before your formal practice to stay watchful of these particular objects so you are able to recognize and note them sooner. But it doesn‚Äôt have to stop there. You can accelerate this process by grinding experience points off the couch, because if this particular enemy is getting you down during formal practice, it will probably get you elsewhere. Now you have more motivation to cultivate mindfulness in other activities like eating, cleaning, practicing hygiene, phone/computer use, walking- whatever you can think of where you can break apart the autopilot- and during such activities, you have more chances to encounter and note the particular object, thus improving accuracy and recognition time at a faster rate.

1i1kiot‚ú∫‚≠ÜEntrepreneur‚ú∫‚≠ÜI will absolutely be rich one day. ‚ú∫‚≠ÜI'm a 23 year old college student that works full time while attending classes. I've worked at a storage facility for around a year. Before I worked here, I thought that I'd go to school, get my degree, and work a 9-5 making 100-160k a year and be happy. Working here has completely changed my outlook on life.\n\nOften times I get average customer (or assholes), but sometimes I meet people that are super inspiring and interesting. I've gotten personalized advice and exchanged contact information with CEO's of energy companies, automobile manufacturers, trucking companies, house flippers, oil company sales directors, etc. The types of people that make over 500k a year. I've been offered a business broker job.\n\nI've realized that these people are normally happy to chat and share advice, such as how they started, around how much they make a year, problems they've encountered, recommendations for me. They normally say finish school and use the income to start something of my own. Maybe they see themselves in me.\n\nThere is no way that I will work a 9-5 for the rest of my life. I understand the security and comfort that people get from it, but I want greater in life. I'm absolutely materialistic, but I don't think it's a nasty word as some people use it. I like nice things. Within the last year of working here, ive began reselling. I've been pretty profitable on FBA, Ebay, Facebook Marketplace. But I need to scale up, I need something more official and consistent.\n\nI want the freedom to say "Fuck it, I think ill book a flight to Japan today", and not have to worry about things like a boss telling me whether or not I can go or if I have enough money saved up. I hate the feeling of being sleepy in the morning, but having to drag myself out of bed to keep my 18.50/hr job (though it's a great job  as a student). Seeing my dad work a job that was harsh on his body for over 20 years, just to recently start making $150k/yr has inspired me to be better.\n\nI started this semester classes yesterday, and my engineering graphics teacher was saying "You guys want this degree so you can get a good job, work for a good company, and after 30 to 40 years, retire". It scared me a bit. That sounded terrible! Making another person richer and richer. Fuck that. Humans live for around 77 years on average, and I need to make the most of it. I've already wasted years of my life dicking around for 4 years after highschool at a shitty job. I'm just glad this revelation has occurred to me now. \n\nI'll be finishing up my ME degree over the next few years, and in the mean time saving as much money as I can. I'm not super sure what I'll do exactly. I've been interested in house hacking, and could see myself buying a duplex while renting out the other half, and selling after a few years to reinvest in larger properties. I'll continue asking every customer that comes in for advice, and if they do any kinds of business or investments. I've learned not to judge a person by what they wear or drive. Some of the richest people I've met drove a basic ass car. People you could google.\n\nMaybe I'll start a company of some sorts, I have no idea. I've gotten advice in the meantime to open up an LLC and a business credit card and make super tiny transactions on it, so when I have my "big-boy job", ill have a larger credit line. I think I'll use this next year at this job to network with as many people as possible, maintain my high GPA, and continue developing skills during downtime, like programming.\n\nIf anybody has life / financial advice stories they'd be willing to share I'd appreciate it. My DM's are open. Seriously, I may be willing to send like 5 bucks or so to people that offer seriously good advice or experience. Good luck everybody.‚ú∫‚≠Ü['I would say this.\xa0\n\nIf money is your end goal you will not be rich one day most likely.

Slight Edge \nHolyyyyy shit this book gets me hard. \n\nIn the slight edge you learn basically success is just you doing the tiny things every single time and the author essentially says if your goal is a Rolls Royce, you pay for it .25 cents a day. \n\nAs long as you don‚Äôt stop you‚Äôll get it.\n\nMost people just quit after a year or two because it‚Äôs taking so long, but after around 3-5 years the money that‚Äôs all built up on the background suddenly explodes. \n\nIt‚Äôs an amazing book.\n\n2.

92onia‚ú∫‚≠ÜEntrepreneur‚ú∫‚≠ÜIF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT MAKING MONEY THEN HERE'S SOME WAYS TO START TODAY GOD DAMNIT‚ú∫‚≠ÜI understand this may come off as harsh, but this is coming from a place of deep love and respect - I KNOW how valuable your time really is and I so desperately want you to see this truth for yourself.\n\nYOU NEED SOME MOMENTUM - TO SEE THE DOLLARS COME IN AND CONFIRM THAT YOU CAN DO IT!\n\nIf this post helps one person TAKE ACTION, I will be so happy! There's nothing better in life than teaching someone how to fish (or showing them that fishing is a skill they can easily learn!)\n\nTo be frank, there's so much bulllshit online - and soo many of you are complete posers who aren't serious about making money.\n\nYou 'want' to make money (who the fuck doesn't?), but you never take any fucking action. \n\nI want to talk about practical ways to make money NOW.\n\nNot some long ass gameplan..\n\nRIGHT. THE FUCK. NOW!\n\nThis is definitely more geared towards people just getting started.. (As this is how I started my entrepreneurial journey)\n\nPersonally I believe IF YOU'RE SERIOUS - YOU CAN START MAKING MONEY TODAY! (Otherwise you may be bs-ing yourself and being an entrepreneur isn't for you :/ )\n\nI know what I'm talking about. I've sold hundreds of thousands of items online over the past 10 years.. \n\nMy path has taken me into a specific niche (anyone here like LEGO?), so I don't do this anymore on this level.. But I still have such a sweet spot for the simple art of buying and selling misc things - and I believe this is the key to getting started!\n\nHere are some ways I've made money buying and selling over the years..\n\n(And no, I don't want anything from you - I just hope this maybe helps someone get started TODAY!)\n\n'BUY LOW SELL HIGH'\n\nThere are millions of items out there that you can make money on..\n\nEverything has a value.\n\nI have bought many things for less than a dollar that I have resold for hundreds..\n\nFirst of all you gotta know how to find what things sell for online..\n\n'HOW DO I FIND ITEMS VALUES?'\n\nSearch 'sold' items on Ebay - and this will show you how much the thing is worth.\n\nDo not look at the current items for sale as their true value. Instead look to see what they have sold for in the past! (Many people will overprice their items so you need to see that it has actually sold)\n\n'WHERE DO I FIND THINGS TO SELL?'\n\n+ Thrift stores\n\nCheck your local thrift stores a few times a week - take out your damn phone, and pull up the Ebay app.\n\nIf you pick it up, look it up!... seriously! Just Ebay search everything!\n\nMaybe even hundreds of things!\n\nThe most random crap sells for a lot online.\n\nTeacups? Look them up! \n\nOld board games? Look em up!\n\nAction figures? Books? Shoes? Search search search!!\n\nUsually you will want to pay less than $5 and resell for at least $25.\n\nI always liked to talk to the employees and tell them what I was doing - \n\nOver the years I made friends with them and they helped me know what new items have shown up in their shop that could be good to resell!\n\n+ Yard sales (Oh god I love yard sales!!)\n\nHave a game plan the day before you go out - research and know where you'll be driving. This way you know where to go before you hit the road.\n\nFind community yard sales so you can hit up a bunch at once..\n\nGet up early!\n\nMy secret to yard sales: Walk up to the owner and ask them if they have whatever it is you're looking for! If you're super nice and polite and respectful, many times they will go into the house and bring it out for you!\n\nThis way you can be on the hunt! And you can check WAY more yard sales throughout the day by not wasting any time looking around! \n\n+ Craigslist \n\nBesides searching for items to resell, try writing a post where you are COMPLETELY OPEN WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING!\n\nPersonally I think this is a gamechanger.\n\nMake a post under the 'wanted' section - and have the title be something like 'WANTED: Anything, really'\n\nExplain that you sell items online, and you will be able to pay cash for anything that can be resold on Ebay. \n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of responses I've gotten for this! The coolest people respond and you will be flooded with options of things you can make money on.\n\nPeople respect the hell out of honesty - and they're cool with you making money, as long as you're real with them..\n\n+ Ebay\n\nYou don't have to leave the house for this one!\n\nMake an advanced search for whatever you're looking for - with 'Buy it Now' and 'Newly listed' as the search options..\n\nThis will show you the newest items that have been put up for sale - and if you search enough times a day you will eventually find something severely under priced that you can make money on!\n\n+ Ebay to Amazon\n\nMost people want it NOW! So they ignore Ebay and go straight to Amazon.\n\nBecause of this, most items sell for way more on Amazon compared to Ebay!\n\nYou can list items for sale on Amazon now, and once they sell - head over to Ebay and purchase the item and have it shipped to the buyer. Everybody's happy and you keep the difference!\n\n*Note: because you never actually see the product in person, you have to be careful with this one. If the buyer complains you will most likely have to send their money back 100% and take the losa.\n\n+ Alibaba.com\n\nMost likely you've heard of this site. It connects wholesalers from around the world to buyers who want stuff to resell.\n\nEvery fucking thing imaginable is for sale here, with wholesale prices.\n\nThis is definitely more advanced, but WAY EASIER THAN YOU MAY THINK!! \n\nJust a random example of something you can buy and resell - I found wholesale conveyor belts at $500 each. Here in the US they go for $1800! (There's shipping coats and fees, but the profits are still excellent!)\n\nIt takes time to contact them, ask for samples, and wait for delivery (conveyors for example took 1.5 months to arrive) - but there is BIG money here. I've heard people say 70% of items on Amazon were sourced through Alibaba!\n\nThere are definitely many more ways to get started in the world of being your own boss, but I just love the simplicity of buying and selling. You can start that TODAY!\n\nI hope this maybe helps somebody out there get started! \n\nPlease please please let me know if you have any questions!\n\n I don't want anything from you  - I just want to be a help! I wish someone would have told me these things years ago when I was first getting started..\n\nLife can be so damn exciting, you just need to see that it's all possible - you need to prove it to yourself.. and you can do that by starting to make money today!\n\nAnyway that's about it..\n\nHave a wonderful mother fucking day y'all!!\n‚ú∫‚≠Ü['I fully expected a link to buy your book at the bottom of this post tbh. ', 'Sup Gary V', 'I\'m happy you posted this - this is exactly how I started. I went homeless at age 20/21 and was basically not doing anything to get out of the situation. I was squatting in a college house of a girl I had met on Tinder. Went to a couple job interviews (dishwasher and salmon processing in Alaska) but never landed anything. My birthday came up and I got $100 from my dad. $75 immediately went back to my friends that I\'d borrowed from to keep myself fed and I had $25 left. I spent about 5 hours on a Saturday walking to 3 yard sales in the area. I bought a tennis racket for .50 and an unopened Cranium board game for $1. There was an NES Classic for only $50 but I didn\'t have the money for it. I wanted it so bad to sell. Anyway, sold the tennis racket to an Arab living in the house, he was so infatuated by the idea of a tennis racket on his wall. I sold it for $5. Sold Cranium on eBay for I think $15 plus shipping.  \n\n\nThat\'s where it started. I ended up turning this into a full on career for a bit. I didn\'t have a real job. My weekday routine was to go wait in the line for DI (the Goodwill of Utah) to open. There were about 10 regular flippers. One had a nich√© in books and had some kind of scanning device. A few had a nich√© in LEGOs (I later learned why - they remain extremely valuable even after being used). Some had a nich√© in name brand glasses and clothing. Me? Pretty much anything in the Yard or Collectibles. Board games were my shit though. I could always find shrinkwrapped board games and resell them for great money. I would get versions of Risk and Ticket to Ride for $1 each and they\'d sell for $40-$60. Pottery became a bit of a nich√© for me. Hull and McCoy are the best. If you can learn your pottery, you can edge out competition and make good money because many people don\'t know pottery and it\'s super collectible. Decent furniture would work for me if I could fit it in my car - I could usually flip good furniture same day on Facebook. Most notably, barstools in good condition. I once bought a tiny box of glass cartridges of some sort. It was .50 and I had no clue what it was but it was so cheap and I was curious, so I bought it. Turned out to be vacuum tubes for a Fender amp. they sold for about $60 I think.  \n\n\nAnyway, I ended up turning that into a consistent $1,900/month income, which wasn\'t great, but to only work 1-2 hours per day and enjoy the novelty of learning everything, it\'s been my favorite job to date (aside from what I do now). Now, I have utilized Alibaba to start my own Amazon store and am pulling about $3,500/wk in profit. Though, to be fair, my main income is from a product I invented and used Alibaba to find a manufacturer. Not a lot of it comes from buying and reselling existing products.  \n\n\nThis is great advice and you broke it down very well, including teaching people how to use the Completed Listings/"Sold" filter on eBay to find true price. There\'s a new Deseret Industries (thrift shop) opening right by my house and I\'m considering picking throughout the week just to entertain myself.']

1iinqc6‚ú∫‚≠Üpassive_income‚ú∫‚≠ÜI Paid $300 for This Etsy POD Method and I'm Giving It Away for Free!‚ú∫‚≠ÜHey everyone, I invested $300 in an Etsy Print-on-Demand (POD) method, and honestly, I feel like it's information that should be accessible to everyone. So, I'm sharing the core strategy with you all for free! This is an evergreen niche that you can jump into almost immediately with very little to no investment.  With some effort, you could realistically make $500/month profit to start, and from there, the sky's the limit!\n\nGetting Started:\n\nYou'll need an Etsy shop, which costs $15 to set up.  However, you can get 40 free listings through a referral. I won't post mine directly out of integrity, but it's easy to find. Just search "40 free listings" on Etsy and click on a random shop.  Look in their shop description for their referral link.\nMake Printful or Prentify account and link it to Etsy.\nWhile this method focuses on Etsy, you can also apply it to other POD platforms like Redbubble, Teespring, Teepublic, Zazzle, and more.\nThe Method:\n\nThis strategy revolves around leveraging the popularity of celebrities, artists, musicians, actors, etc.\nChoose a Celebrity: \nPick someone with a dedicated fanbase.\n Find a Quote:\nSelect a memorable quote, song lyric, or phrase that resonates with their audience. \n Create a Design:  This is where the magic happens! Let's say Taylor Swift has a line "Karma is a cat." You could design an image of a woman holding a cat that embodies the concept of Karma.\n\nAI Design Magic:\n Use Ideogram (Free): Go to Ideogram and use a prompt like:  "Please make me a vector graphic design that perfectly resembles this quote (insert your quote here) that also resonates with the audience and interacts with them."\n\nRefine in Canva Pro: Copy the design from Ideogram and go to Canva Pro (In a previous post, I mentioned I could help others get Canva Pro lifetime access for cheap price, thanks to everyone who trusted me‚Äì DM me for info). Upscale the design, remove background with BG remover, download your images as PNG, make any necessary adjustments, and polish it.\n\nListing and Marketing:\nCreate Multiple Designs: Aim for at least 10 designs like this daily to build a solid catalog.\nMockups are Key: Use Canva Pro's mockup tools to create professional-looking product mockups. This will make your listings stand out.\n\nUpload to Etsy: \nUpload your designs with relevant tags and titles. Take full advantage of your 40 free listings.\nStay free and unlimited!: you also can sell your designs to Etsy as SVGs, I used this before and sometimes it was more profitable than POD, don't limit yourself to one thing.\nStay Consistent:  Consistency is crucial.  The more designs you have, the better your chances of success.\nImportant Considerations:\n Avoid Naming the Artist Directly: Don't mention the celebrity's name in your titles or descriptions. You can use their name in your tags.\n\nCopyright: Double-check that the quote you're using isn't copyrighted. If it's in the public domain, including the quote as text in your designs can boost conversions.\n\nPatience: \n Don't expect overnight success.  Give your shop time to grow and your designs time to gain traction.\nThis method is very profitable and everyone can jump into it.\n It requires some effort, but the low startup cost and the potential returns make it a worthwhile venture.

1itghje‚ú∫‚≠Ügetdisciplined‚ú∫‚≠ÜA Complete 3-Step Guide to Quit Any Addiction‚ú∫‚≠ÜI'm making this post to save you from wasting years of your life trying to quit, just like I did.  \n(I've posted this on other subreddits as well to help as many people as possible)\n\nBut first, let me give you a quick introduction- 2 and a half years ago, I decided to improve my life. With that I realized that I unfortunately had multiple addictions-¬†**porn, phone addiction, junk food/sugar, video games, binging TV shows, etc.**\n\nNow, allow me to flex.\n\n* About 450 days ago, I watched porn for the last time in my life.\n* At the start of this year, my screen time went officially from 8 hours to 30 minutes.\n* I also decided to go sugar-free (added sugars) 8 months ago to test myself (and I'm still successful)\n\nAnd finally, I can confidently say that I have understood everything necessary to break free from bad habits/addictions. I barely even get any cravings anymore. Keep in mind it wasn't always like this- I went through the same struggles you face and made mistakes on my journey.\n\nI hope this helps as much as it would've helped me a couple of years ago, but anyways here's EVERYTHING I learnt after successfully breaking free from my addictions:\n\n**1- Gradual decrease > Cold turkey**\n\nA while after I quit my porn addiction, I came across a video of a guy explaining that completely quitting all at once isn't going to work. It made sense. I started to reflect back and realized that with every streak I held, the amount of days I abstained kept increasing and increasing, up until I could stop for 30 days comfortably, at which point I quit for good.\n\nSo basically, I unknowingly used a gradual decrease, and it worked.\n\nIt makes sense- your brain wouldn't be used to having absolutely no dopamine spikes after being used to experiencing dopamine rushes for the past couple of years of your life.\n\nThen, I implemented this principle to quit my phone addiction and junk food.\n\nI do think I could have quit a lot quicker if I maintained a written plan and tracked my indulgences rather than having a rough idea. It might sound weird to 'schedule' your next relapse but instead think of it as achieving small goals of abstaining, that in the long run, will lead to you becoming free. I think a gradual decrease over a couple of months will work.\n\n**2- PURPOSE**\n\nPeople think that discipline is the most important thing when it comes to quitting, but it isn't. I realized that there was a technique that was much more effective than resisting cravings.\n\nAnd that is- getting rid of the craving in the first place.\n\nYes, it is possible to eliminate, or at least drastically reduce, the amount of urges you get.  \nHow do I know this? Because I've done it myself. I can't say for sure that I NEVER get cravings, but finding purpose in life has 100% worked for me.\n\nThink about why you want to live your life (hard question- I know haha) and be as ambitious as possible. For example, I want to become a successful entrepreneur who can change the lives of many people while becoming financially free.\n\nNow, you might think doing this is irrelevant, but please stick with me on this one.  \nHere's the thing; I was trying to quit my addictions, but I didn't know WHY I was trying.\n\nYour brain will not give up your addictions unless it realizes that there is are benefits that make it worth quitting. "He who has a why can bare for almost any how".  \nSo- think about your dreams in life, and ask yourself how quitting will benefit you.\n\nThis shifts the focus from you STRUGGLING to quit, to now BENEFITING from abstaining.  \nThis also boosts your discipline like crazy since it's a lot easier to view things logically.\n\nAlso, you will end up falling back into addiction if you have no clue what you are going to spend your time on. I replaced the time and energy by mainly pursuing entrepreneurship, along with other things like sports, working out, reading, sleeping more, so on and so forth.\n\nI suggest having one key passion to devote most of your time to, and then doing other healthy or enjoyable things on the side.\n\n**3- CUES AND RESPONSE**\n\nThis is by far the easiest part of the journey.  \nThe habit loop consists of 4 parts: Cue -> Craving -> Response -> Reward  \n(Craving is sometimes omitted since it's closely linked to reward, but yeah)\n\nPurpose handles craving and reward, but now let's focus on what TRIGGERS you to start the ROUTINE of the habit.\n\nIn order to eliminate cues, which is once again stupidly simple, you need to CHANGE YOUR ENVIRONMENT. For example, I simply put my phone in a drawer instead of on the table, and boom- my triggers for my phone addiction fell by roughly 50%. All because my phone was out of sight.\n\nDon't believe me? What if I told you that 95% of American soldiers addicted to heroin during the Vietnam War were able to easily quit as soon as they came back home?\n\nSo- think about your cues- and find a way to remove them from your life. Be strict with this. Don't come up with excuses.\n\nAnd finally, to reduce your response to bad habits, INCREASE FRICTION. This is basically adding more steps to complete before indulging in your addiction. The idea behind this is that when your brain realizes that effort is needed to do something, it puts it off and procrastinates. And yes- this applies to the things we want to quit as well.\n\nAs soon as I read about this from Atomic Habits- I implemented it and understood that the human brain is pretty simple. And silly.\n\nSo just make your bad habit harder to do. For example, I kept the controller to my gaming console in another room, and deleted the apps on my phone. The added effort and time needed to indulge now made my brain crave these things less. TRY THIS FOR YOURSELF, PLEASE.\n\nAlright, I spent about half an hour writing everything above, and I really do hope it helps.\n\nMy DMs are open if you need anything else. TAKE ACTION, and all the best ahead :)‚ú∫‚≠Ü['TLDR\n\nThe best way to break a bad habit is to replace it with a good one.\n\n‚Äì Jerome Hines', 'Great job, OP! You should be proud of yourself. That said, it‚Äôs important to recognize the significant difference between heavier substances‚Äîsuch as crack, meth, heroin, opiates, and alcohol‚Äîand how intensely they hijack the dopaminergic reward system.

1itbabt‚ú∫‚≠Ügetdisciplined‚ú∫‚≠ÜStudying with ADHD: A Reality-Based Guide‚ú∫‚≠ÜAs someone with ADHD, I've learned that effective studying isn't about forcing our brains to work like everyone else's. It's about working WITH our unique wiring, not against it. Here's what actually works:\n\nFirst of all, of course - Planning\n\nInstead of making elaborate study plans that you'll abandon by tomorrow (which i do most of the time), try this:\n\n\- Plan only your next study session (2 hours max)\n\n\- Break it into 25-minute chunks\n\n\- Decide on ONE main thing to tackle\n\n\- Have a backup task for when your brain inevitably rebels against the main task ( i do this almost 50% of the time)\n\n2. Environment tips \n\nYour study space needs to work with your ADHD brain:\n\n\- Create different study "stations" to switch between (you can choose from "rate my study space" memes from this subreddit :D)\n\n\- Keep fidget toys nearby (seriously, they help and no, I'm not 12)\n\n\- Have snacks and water within reach\n\n\- Use noise-canceling headphones or background noise that works for you (i have two small siblings so a lot of background noise) \n\n\- Consider body doubling (studying with someone else present, even virtually)\n\n3. focus tips\n\nInstead of trying to force hours of continuous focus:\n\n\- Use the "stupid small" approach: Start with just 5 minutes\n\n\- Switch subjects when you feel your attention drifting (no one is perfect)\n\n\- Mix active and passive learning methods\n\n\- Take advantage of hyperfocus when it hits\n\n\- Use timers to avoid time blindness + background music (no lyrics preferably)\n\n4. Making Information Stick\n\nour ADHD brains need more engagement:\n\n\- Create mind maps instead of linear notes\n\n\- Teach concepts to others (even if it's just explaining to your cat, or you can explain to the toy i mentioned before)\n\n\- Use color and movement in your study materials\n\n\- Connect new information to things you're already interested in\n\n\- Record voice notes for later review (it's kinda cringe for me to hear my voice later on, but i listen it on bus usually)\n\n5. The Daily Reality Check / journaling (it's really hard to do it everyday, but it'd still work even once a week)\n\neach day do a quick reflection:\n\n\- What actually worked today?\n\n\- What made you lose focus?\n\n\- What would make tomorrow easier?\n\n\- When did you feel most engaged?\n\nThe uncomfortable truth you have to accept about ADHD:\n\n\- Some days will be harder than others\n\n\- What works this week might not work next week\n\n\- You might need to explain your methods to professors or study partners\n\n\- Traditional study groups might not be your thing\n\n\- Your best studying might happen at "weird" times\n\nRemember:\n\n\- Progress isn't linear\n\n\- Adaptation beats rigid systems\n\n\- Self-compassion is crucial\n\n\- Your unique approach is valid\n\n\n\nAction Steps (Pick Just ONE):\n\n1. Try studying for 25 minutes with a timer\n\n2. Set up one study station with everything you need\n\n3. Record yourself explaining one concept\n\n4. Draw one mind map\n\n5. Find one study buddy for body doubling\n\n\n\nThe most important thing isn't following all these suggestions perfectly. It's about starting somewhere or    and building from there. Your ADHD brain is different, and that's okay. Work with it, NOT AGAINST it.\n\nStart with drinking that water. Then pick one tiny thing from this post. That's enough for now.\n\nP.S. Keep track of what works for YOU. Your perfect study system might look nothing like this post, and that's exactly how it should be.\n\nRight now, just write down ONE thing you want to understand better. That's it. Start there.

1j7zizx‚ú∫‚≠Ügetdisciplined‚ú∫‚≠Ü5 brutal truths i learned after trying digital detox‚ú∫‚≠ÜA year ago, my screen time was around 13 hours per day. I wasn‚Äôt just scrolling - I was living online. I‚Äôd check TikTok first thing in the morning, doomscroll through lunch, and somehow find myself on Reddit at 3 am reading about 17th-century shipwrecks. My attention span? Gone. My motivation? Nonexistent. One day i got a flip phone and tried to log off for weeks at a time. At first, I nearly lost my mind. But after two days, I started reading again, actually talking to my family, and remembering what it was like to exist outside the algorithm. If you‚Äôre stuck in the infinite scroll, these books will break your brain (in a good way). Here are the 5 things I learnt from those readings, along with thoughtful summaries of the chapters that resonated with me most:\n\n**\- Your focus is stolen - here‚Äôs how to get it back**\n\n[**Stolen Focus**](https://befreed.ai/book/stolen-focus-by-johann-hari/heart) **by Johann Hari** explains why our attention spans are fried. Spoiler: it‚Äôs not just you, it‚Äôs the entire system. This book made me realize I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúlazy‚Äù - I was just overstimulated. Here‚Äôs a quote from the summary of the most impactful chapter about how the big techs hijacked our focus: "The business model driving this system is what Shoshana Zuboff calls "surveillance capitalism"-the extraction of behavioral data to predict and influence future behavior. Under this model, users aren't customers; they're the product being sold to advertisers. The more precisely platforms can target ads, the more they can charge, creating relentless pressure to gather ever more intimate data and hold attention ever more effectively.\nThis system doesn't just waste our time-it reshapes our information environment in profound ways. Algorithms optimize for engagement, not truth or social value, leading to the amplification of emotionally triggering content, particularly content that provokes outrage. Research shows that moral and emotional language spreads farther and faster online, especially negative emotions like anger. This creates a media ecosystem that systematically promotes division and extremism."\n\n\n**\- You don‚Äôt need more willpower, you need a new system**\n\n[**Indistractable**](https://befreed.ai/book/indistractable-by-nir-eyal/heart) **by Nir Eyal** (behavioral design expert, legit researcher) isn‚Äôt some ‚Äújust put your phone down‚Äù advice. It teaches how to train your brain to resist distractions. The best part? It‚Äôs practical AF. No fluff, just straight-up methods that work. Below is a key quote from the summary that really hit me hard and encouraged me to make changes:\n"To overcome these internal triggers, you need to believe in yourself. The way you speak to yourself is crucial. If you tell yourself you're lazy or incapable, you'll likely act that way. Instead, use positive self-talk, just as you would encourage a friend. Adopt rituals like mantras, routines, and positive behaviors to reinforce a positive self-image."\n\n**\- your brain wasn‚Äôt built for infinite scrolling**\n\n[**The Shallows**](https://befreed.ai/book/the-shallows-by-nicholas-carr/heart) **by Nicholas Carr** breaks down how the internet rewires our brains for short-term dopamine hits. Ever felt like you used to be able to read long books but now struggle with a single article? Yeah, this book explains why and how to fix it.\n\n**\- boredom is a superpower**\n\n[**Digital Minimalism**](https://befreed.ai/book/digital-minimalism-by-cal-newport) **by Cal Newport** argues that we need to relearn boredom to regain focus. At first, I thought this sounded stupid - but when I actually tried it, my brain felt so much better. Letting yourself be bored is the key to creativity and deep thinking.\n\n**\- You‚Äôre not as in control as you think**\n\n**Hooked by Nir Eyal** (same guy as Indistractable) exposes how apps are designed to get you addicted. Reading this felt like seeing the Matrix. After finishing it, I deleted half the apps on my phone because I finally understood exactly how they were manipulating me. Insane read.\n\nIf social media has hijacked your life, here‚Äôs my advice: take a break. Not just for a few hours, but for weeks. Use a flip phone, go offline, let your brain detox. It‚Äôll suck at first, but trust me - after a few days, you‚Äôll feel human again. And if you don‚Äôt know what to do with all that extra time? Read. It might just rewire your brain in the best way possible.‚ú∫‚≠Ü["The really sad part was when I was scrolling Google news like it was instagram. Literally, doing the thumb motion as if some new story was going to be down there somewhere, but it was just the same articles I'd already read.\xa0\n\n\nNow I'm in this weird place where I only have YouTube shorts, and I feel very, very guilty when I catch myself scrolling endlessly while thinking it's time to stop, but the action of 'stopping' always involves scrolling to one more clip to see if it's something cool. And that opens you up to another phase of uncontrolled scrolling.\xa0\n\n\nStay strong Friends. A movement is starting and we're just the early adopters of living in the real world again, ha.", 'This is such a solid breakdown of digital detox and why it‚Äôs so necessary! The way social media rewires our brains is honestly scary, and I love the book recommendations‚Äî*Stolen Focus* and *The Shallows* hit hard.

1jatsz3‚ú∫‚≠Ügetdisciplined‚ú∫‚≠ÜHow I went from chronically lazy to disciplined in 2 years. (Full Guide on Self-Discipline)‚ú∫‚≠ÜHey good day, I‚Äôm someone who used to be chronically lazy, fat and couldn‚Äôt focus on anything for more than 10 minutes 2 years ago. Now I lost 10 kg, do 3 hours of deep work in the morning, follow a 12 hour daily schedule and no longer have trouble fighting laziness.\n\nI‚Äôm here to share what helped from my journey of laziness to disciplined. I hope you take away something useful in this post.\n\nBuckle in. This post is long. Grab a notebook and pen you can use to take down notes.\n\n**This post to those who are struggling and can‚Äôt seem to fix their laziness. You probably struggled for a lot of time already. I now and I‚Äôve been there. If you‚Äôre reading this, make this is your break through.**\n\n**(TLDR can be found at the bottom of the post. Though I highly recommend reading the whole article to understand the connection and how they each part interacts with each other.**\n\nAnd I‚Äôd like to start with:\n\nThe only way out is to stay consistent. Even if you waste days, weeks, or months if you keep putting in the work you'll gradually build that discipline you wanted.\n\nWe are humans and our energy is limited. This means if you‚Äôre goal is to never procrastinate again that mindset is wrong. Your goal should be to lessen your entertainment consumption using the 2 E‚ÄôS.\n\nE 1 is for EDUCATION:\n\n* The amount of time you use to make your value to the world higher. Meaning your skills, abilities and capabilities. Because the better you are at something the more likely you are to keep doing it.\n\nE 2 is for ENTERTAINMENT:\n\n* This goes to the amount of time you waste. While I do not recommend wasting time, we are humans and we make mistakes. When you mess up forgive yourself. I mess up plenty of times too.\n\nWhy do you need to know all of this?\n\n# DOPAMINE.\n\nThe reason we want to do something is to experience feelings. The chemicals in your body that fire‚Äôs you up when you‚Äôre excited and makes you sad when someone says hurtful things to you.\n\nThis is what motivates and moves us. We as humans are driven by dopamine. Andrew Huberman said it best. *‚ÄúDopamine is war. It‚Äôs drive and motivation‚Äù.*\n\nNo matter what we do is driven by dopamine.\n\nLike what you do?\n\n* ‚Üí Increases Dopamine.\n\nHate what you do?\n\n* ‚Üí Lowers dopamine\n\nWhen I didn‚Äôt know any of this. I always wondered why I was wasting time. I was awake till 12am and still out there scrolling in social media and watching highly edited videos.\n\nEven though I was filling my mind with dopamine I was still having trouble knowing what to do.\n\n# Fixing laziness through dopamine.\n\nIf you‚Äôre someone who stays in bed, naps all day and can‚Äôt seem to do anything productively that‚Äôs because your brain is fried. Everything you do is boring so why do it at all? I know because I was like that too.\n\nWhen dopamine is over the top and it‚Äôs too much. Your body won‚Äôt move or want to do anything unless the stimuli in your brain is higher. And good habits have very low stimuli in our brains but bad habits spike them to the top.\n\nThe way to fix this is simple.\n\n* Schedule what time you want to waste and laze around. This sounds counter productive but if you look at your screen time. It‚Äôs probably over 10 hours if you aren‚Äôt lying. So if you schedule 3 hours of time wasting, this means you‚Äôve just gained 7 hours of time. I had mine for over 12 hours and I decided to waste 4 hours. I got back 8 hours of time.\n* Journal what you do throughout the day and minimize all activities that causes a big spike in dopamine. Meaning your bad habits need to be regulated. I made progress when I become aware I was spending over 12 hours on my phone daily.\n* Make your education time than entertainment higher. For example you do 2 hours of entertainment, then you have to put up with doing 2hours and 10 minutes of education. Though this might be too much if you‚Äôre new. I highly suggest doing at least 10 minutes of education if you can‚Äôt overdrive your entertainment. Don‚Äôt let the ego get in the way too.\n\n# Habit formation. How to do it right.\n\nThe key to habit building is making it easy. Do not rely on motivation. It‚Äôs a friend that comes when you don‚Äôt want to and goes away when you need it the most. Use will power instead. But not the will power like ‚ÄúDavid Goggin‚Äôs‚Äù ultra discipline type. I found this the most useful.\n\nHere‚Äôs the process:\n\n1. Make it stupidly easy - If you are new to the gym you wouldn‚Äôt bench press 100kg. You would start with the empty barbell. The same principle goes to building habits. You make it stupidly easy it‚Äôs impossible to fail. This means instead of doing meditation for 1 hour you do 1 minute. This sounds cringe but it works. Back then I couldn‚Äôt even be productive for 30 minutes. So I decided to stick to doing 1 thing everyday for 10 minutes. I made the requirement so small that I could do it even in bad days.\n2. Don‚Äôt do it twice when you mess up - You have to stay consistent on the thing you‚Äôve set on. You must not over do it when you skipped yesterday. This causes problems and makes you intimidated to start instead. Don‚Äôt do 2 hours of studying because you missed yesterdays 1 hour of studying session. It doesn‚Äôt work. I always felt more intimidated of doing the work instead of motivated.\n3. Stay consistent - Do not quit if you‚Äôve been having trouble of had problems. If you got off for a week get back to it as soon as possible. You must never quit forever. You can take breaks but never forever. The key is to get back on track as soon as possible. That way you can stick and actually make results later. I was on and off my good habits. I would skip days and sometimes weeks. Just get back to it as soon as possible.\n\n# Sleep. How it helps you overcome laziness.\n\nSleep is the best legal performance enhancing drug. So if you only sleep around 4-5 hours like I did obviously you won‚Äôt feel productive and energetic.\n\nSince energy plays a vital role in becoming disciplined.\n\n* More energy = Higher chances of being productive.\n* Less energy = Higher chances of being lazy.\n\nI remember when I would sleep at 12 am the next day I would feel sluggish and tired. I would always scroll first thing in the morning and waste at least 2 hours watching in YouTube.\n\nBut now I don‚Äôt and I fixed it. I slept early, got more energy and actually became disciplined. I even have sometimes too much energy throughout the day that I get shocked at how much I get done.\n\nTo fix your sleep I recommend 3 things. This is how I also did it.\n\n1. Tire your body - The reason you are not able to sleep fast at night is because your body isn‚Äôt tired. This means your body is not seeking rest or recovery. And when it isn‚Äôt, it doesn‚Äôt want to sleep. It wants to use that energy and get tired. So tire your body during the morning and you‚Äôll have an easier time to sleep. I decided to clean our house more than required. Enough to make me tired at nighttime.\n2. Schedule - You need to sleep daily and consistently everyday. This way your body clock gets regulated and fixed. You‚Äôll have to put up not being able to sleep properly for a few days but once you get this rolling it becomes easier. I found this easy to follow once you practice it over a week.\n3. No phone 1 hour before bed - Blue light causes our eyes to go dry and makes our mind stay awake. This means you need to stay away from screens near your bedtime. That way you‚Äôll have an easier time to sleep and stay on track. I always notice the difference when I would scroll before sleeping. My eyes would dry out and cause my brain to stay alert. But if I don‚Äôt I can feel my eyes being sleepy helping me sleep faster.\n\n# Don‚Äôt trust motivation. Use will power instead.\n\nMotivation cannot be trusted. It‚Äôs like a toxic friend that comes when you don‚Äôt want to and comes away when you need it. Instead of relying on watching motivational videos and indulging in mindless consumption. I highly recommend just accepting the suck.\n\n**The suck is doing the hard work you don‚Äôt want to do. It‚Äôs painful and uncomfortable but you do it. And that‚Äôs how you build will power. I made progress when I accepted I have to put in the work even if I don‚Äôt want to. But the problem is most people do it too hard. They do 1 hour of meditation or 1 hour of exercise and you‚Äôll end up not doing it since it‚Äôs too hard. Been there too.**\n\nHere‚Äôs what to do instead:\n\n* Choose 1 thing you don‚Äôt want to do. E.g. working out or waking up early or doing house chores.\n* Do the bare minimum. Don‚Äôt do 1 hour of meditation. Do 1 minute instead.\n* Schedule when you are going to do it. Early in the morning? Afternoon? Evening?\n* Be specific about it. What time? 6am? 7am? 12nn? 8pm?\n\nI was down bad back in the days. Focusing for even 10 minutes was close to impossible. So I decided to lower the bar so low it made it impossible for me to fail.\n\nOver time you should add more habits. The good ones.\n\n# Good habits.\n\nThere are a lot of good habits I can talk about but I will only tackle 3. Which were the most helpful in my discipline journey.\n\n* Tracker journal - Everyday before sleeping I wrote down what I did. This made me more inspired and motivated to work harder.\n* Working out- The more I built my muscles the more confident I got. This made me more inclined to keep doing my good habits.\n* Reading- I didn‚Äôt start reading physical books. Those were too intimidating. I started reading digitally in my phone using some app that summarizes book learnings. It would only take me 5 minutes a day which made it easier to do.\n\nThis habits came about after 2 months after I‚Äôve built some foundation.\n\nThis 3 habits built my foundation of discipline. Yours will be different but with similar habits. You don‚Äôt have to follow mine but it‚Äôs a good start if you don‚Äôt know what to do.\n\n**I also highly recommend reading the summary to really internalize all of this information.**\n\nTLDR (Summary) :\n\n* Education should overdrive entertainment. Since if you don‚Äôt you fry your dopamine reward system. Aim to at least make your education time higher than entertainment everyday. If you can‚Äôt keep trying.\n* Dopamine controls what we do. We are prone to do pleasurable activities such as doom scrolling because it‚Äôs considered fun by the brain. Lower your dopamine baseline by gradually eliminating bad habits. To ensure the habits you do are pleasurable and fun. The lower your dopamine the better and easier it is for you to do hard work while having fun.\n* Your habits dictate your future. Build the right habits by 1) Making it stupidly easy 2) Don‚Äôt do twice if you skipped a day 3) Forgive yourself when you mess up.\n* Fix your sleep and your productivity skyrockets. Sleep is the best performance enhancing drug. The more energy you get from sleep the better your chances of doing hard things. To sleep better 1) Tire your body during the day with physical activities 2) Schedule bed time 3) No phone in 1 hour before bed.\n* Don‚Äôt trust motivation and use will power. Motivation is unreliable. Will power on the other hand will make you mentally stronger and makes it easier for you do to hard work. Lower the bar so low it‚Äôs impossible to fail. e.g. 1 minute of meditation over 1 hour.\n* Good habits are good for consistency. Read, workout and track your daily activities. This makes you more motivated and healthy overall.\n\nI hoped you liked this summary. If this is hard to understand I highly recommend reading the whole post.

1jt2dn3‚ú∫‚≠Ügamedev‚ú∫‚≠ÜThe Story of How Our Game Made Almost $500K Gross in 1 Month After a Year of Development‚ú∫‚≠ÜThis is going to be a long and detailed post‚Äîso buckle up if you're into that kind of thing! Otherwise, here‚Äôs a TL;DR (that‚Äôs still kinda long).\n\nWhile writing this, I realized just how much info there is to share, so I edited it down. If other devs are interested, I‚Äôd be happy to follow up with more detailed posts‚Äîespecially about our ad strategy during Next Fest or anything else you'd like to dive deeper into.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nWe released a successful game after 1 year of development, as a studio that's been together for 5 years. Despite a great launch, we made a number of mistakes that led to fair criticism in reviews. We‚Äôre actively working on improvements through updates, but here‚Äôs the overall timeline of we got here:\n\n* **Feb 2024**: Secured funding\n* **Mar 2024**: Selected *Do No Harm* as our primary project\n* **June 2024**: Showcased early version at Baku Game Summit, got feedback from Rami Ismail, redesigned core loop\n* **Late Sep 2024**: Steam page goes live, \~1500 wishlists in 1 week (\~500 on Day 1)\n* **Jan 29, 2025**: Trailer launches, \~14,400 total wishlists right before that\n* **Feb 24 (Next Fest)**: \~50K wishlists right before (Jan 29‚ÄìFeb 23 avg: 1431/day, peak: 3712)\n* **Next Fest**: Top #50 demo, median playtime: 52 minutes\n* **Mar 6 (Launch)**: 105K wishlists\n* **Launch Metrics**:\n   * Day 1: \~7.5K units / \~$82K gross\n   * Week 1: \~26K units / \~$280K gross\n   * Month 1: \~44K units / \~$480K gross\n* **Next steps**: Major update in 3‚Äì6 weeks to address community feedback, and maybe console port in a few months.\n\n# Why I'm Sharing This\n\nThis post isn‚Äôt to advertise (gamedevs aren‚Äôt really our target audience) or to brag. I was inspired by other transparent devs like Alex Blintsov (*Furnish Master*), who openly shared his data with the community. While I won‚Äôt go quite as deep, I want to talk about what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and what we learned along the way while making [*Do No Harm*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3138780/Do_No_Harm/). Also, this is not exactly Post-Mortem (I wasn't sure what other tag to choose), as I don't consider our game dead yet - we are planning to continue working on it for a while. But maybe in a year or so, I'll do a full post-mortem focusing specifically on our mistakes.\n\n# Background\n\nWe founded our studio in 2019 with six devs, all with some experience in games. Our first project was overly ambitious, and by 2021 it had to be put on hold due to scope creep and lack of experience. We turned to outsourcing to stay afloat, while occasionally experimenting with smaller internal projects.\n\nAfter almost 3 years of outsourcing and through a round of raising funds from an angel investor, we finally secured enough funding to commit to internal development full-time for one year. To reduce risk, we split our efforts into three separate projects‚Äîeach with a 4-month dev cycle. *Do No Harm* was one of them.\n\n# How We Chose the Game\n\nWith our team now at 13 people, everyone pitched their own game ideas. We voted internally and shortlisted three concepts. Then, the senior team picked the most viable one based on two key factors:\n\n* **Market demand**: Using tools like SteamDB, SteamTrends, and Gamalytics to analyze competition and genre viability.\n* **Feasibility**: We imposed hard scope limitations‚Äîe.g., the entire game had to take place in a single environment.\n\nThat left us with two finalists:\n\n* A *Papers, Please*\-style spooky doctor sim\n* An *FTL*\-like steampunk mecha game\n\nWhile the *FTL*\-like seemed safer, we believed the doctor game had more potential if executed right. Our lead designer who came up with the idea in the first place, Omar Israfilov, was especially passionate about the idea, and we decided to go all in.\n\n# Early Development\n\nThe original prototype looked and especially played very differently from the current game. We aimed for a 2D/3D blend, inspired by *The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack*‚Äîjuxtaposing smooth character art with grotesque close-ups. Our art team (who had previously done AAA outsourcing) worked hard to achieve this style, though technical and time constraints forced some compromises. Here is [Evolution of Art post](https://imgur.com/a/G4Q8HgC) (it's missing some stages that I will add later on).\n\nBy June 2024, at the Baku Game Summit, the game was focused on deduction using the symptoms the patients would give you, and combing through the Book of Medicine for treatment methods. The biggest difference from the current version was that you‚Äôd always find the correct answer in the book if you looked carefully enough while now you have to take some risks and work with imperfect information. The Lovecraftian elements were also barely there.\n\nPlayers at the event showed interest, but also clear sign of boredom. Our initial plan was to just add more features or raise the difficulty curve, but then we met Rami Ismail, who gave us some amazing advice: instead of pure logic puzzles, shift the game mechanics to taking calculated risks and making informed guesses.\n\nThis became the core loop: "fuzzy" decisions over rigid deduction. Humor and tension emerged from the uncertainty. His advice helped us make the core loop more about making educated guesses and taking informed risks with your treatment methods instead of simply solving the disease by combing through the Book of Medicine. This change we made resulted in Humor Circle and a much more interesting playthrough. It made the game more engaging‚Äîbut it also meant we had to rebuild key systems. Eventually, we committed fully to *Do No Harm* and dropped/delayed the other two projects.\n\n# On Publishers and the Steam Page\n\nNow, one of the pieces of advice we also got was to not publish a Steam Page on our own, but rather contact publishers first and see if we can get any of them interested. Our main goal with contacting publishers wasn‚Äôt to get funding, but rather to find someone who would multiply our marketing efforts. That said, we did believe that the game was a potential mini-hit so we were looking for someone to cover our costs especially now that we decided to take the risk of only making one project in a year putting all of our funds into it.¬†\n\nWe reached out to 50 publishers over 4 months. None met our minimum terms. Most only responded after we hit 6K+ wishlists and landed on the ‚ÄúPopular Upcoming‚Äù list. I'm going to make a separate post about our experience with publishers and my thoughts on the whole process.\n\nIn hindsight, waiting for a publishers was a mistake. Unless you're an established name or have an amazing or highly addicitve near-finished vertical slice, publishers will likely pass. Meanwhile, a live Steam page can help generate community interest and improve your bargaining power. It let us refine tags, get early feedback, and most importantly build our Discord.\n\nThe Playtest feature was especially helpful. We even used playtesters' responses to help set the price at $15.99 using a basic pricing survey formula (happy to share more about that if anyone's curious).\n\n# Marketing and Next Fest\n\nSeeing no success from getting publishers even after I presented in front of a great panel at the [Playcon event](https://playcon.gg/2024-event/indie-initiative/) that I was invited to in Malta - I understood that if we want the game to succeed we need to do more. After realizing we‚Äôd likely self-publish (outside China, where we partnered with Hawthorn Games), we focused on visibility. We secured a [trailer slot on GameTrailers](https://youtu.be/RCyjUzA9V08)‚Äîand surprisingly, it blew up. That traction helped us get picked up by IGN‚Äôs main YouTube channel too.\n\nWishlists went from \~100/day to \~1500/day almost overnight.\n\nWe launched a separate demo page on Feb 4 with two goals:\n\n1. Get more eyes on the game and thus feedback. Fix core issues before Next Fest\n2. Use Steam‚Äôs Demo Release Email to notify 40K wishlisters about the demo 1 week before the NextFest\n\nHaving the demo early paid off. It generated word of mouth and allowed us to polish based on the incoming reviews. Next Fest then took the demo results to the next level. We cracked the top 50 demos with a median playtime of 52 minutes despite having only 7 days worth of content (each day being 6 minutes long).\n\nThe NextFest itself was incredibly exciting and nerve-wracking for us. Especially because we knew that almost immediately after the Fest we‚Äôd have to release the game. The decision to release that soon instead of continue to polish was based on two things:\n\n1. We kind of had to. Our funds were running out, and we only had 1-2 more months of burn-rate in us.\n2. We wanted to use the peak of the hype for our game, as well as get some benefit from the Spring Sales via our Launch Discount.\n\nWe tried reaching out to media for another outreach attempt with our Release trailer on March 6th, but due to how delayed its production was, and given how focused we were on fixing all of the issues of the game, we only managed to finish the trailer by March 3rd. That was too late, and I think it was a marketing beat opportunity we lost.\n\n# Launch\n\nThe final pre-launch thing we did was bundling up with Death & Taxes (for an additional 20% discount). We reached out to more games, but unfortunately didn‚Äôt get to bundle in time. With hype at its peak and funds running low, we released on March 6, just 1 hour after finishing the final build (definitely don‚Äôt recommend doing that!). We launched with a 10% launch discount. Despite all of the flaws of the game, the response blew us away:\n\n* **105K wishlists at launch**\n* **Day 1:** 7.5K units / \~$82K gross\n* **Week 1:** 26K units / \~$280K gross\n* **Month 1:** 44K units / \~$480K gross\n\nLooking at our reviews it becomes clear that we didn‚Äôt manage to implement the philosophy of fuzzy choices as well as we wanted to, and most importantly we didn‚Äôt communicate the way it works well. We also have issues with balancing and overall pacing of the game - but given that Do No Harm is our first big release, I still consider what we have done a huge success - especially if we continue to improve upon what we have.¬†\n\nBeyond the numbers, the community has been incredible. The money we have earned has made us very happy, and secure in our future plans, but to be honest the support of our community on Discord, the fan arts, as well as all the YouTube and Twitch streams even from influencer we never reached out to is the main reason we got into gamedev and stuck with it despite 4-5 years of failing to release a game leading to this point. The feeling of seeing so many other people play and enjoy your game (even if they do rightfully complain about certain parts) is incredible.\n\n# What‚Äôs Next\n\nWe‚Äôre working on a Major update to address feedback (especially around balancing, pacing, and communicating the core game loop better). We have also added a few of the most active community members as characters into the game.¬†\n\nBut beyond the game I‚Äôm also giving back to the team that has worked on the game. The whole team got a short paid vacation to spend time with family after the exhausting development we were through. I‚Äôve also increased the wages of everyone on the team, as well as given a bonus based on the net income of the company, in addition to the shares of the company. I believe that in my team we aren‚Äôt making games for the studio or investors, but for ourselves (team members) and the general community. I want everyone on the team to be able to say proudly that they‚Äôve made a game, rather than just worked on a title. Now we also have a dedicated community, and I hope that we‚Äôll be able to keep them engaged and interested with our future games.\n\nLonger term our focus is to:\n\n* Fix internal production and documentation pipelines\n* Start work on a new game (while continuing to support *Do No Harm*)\n* Explore console and mobile ports for Do No Harm\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nThis is our first real release after 4‚Äì5 years of trying and failing. It‚Äôs far from perfect‚Äîbut it‚Äôs a massive step forward for our studio. If you‚Äôre in a similar position, I hope our story gives you a realistic, but hopeful perspective.\n\nFeel free to ask questions‚ÄîI'll try to answer as best I can (might be a bit slow though as it‚Äôs nighttime for me).‚ú∫‚≠Ü["well thought thru, well executed and a result to show for it.

Here‚Äôs what helped me go from brain-fried to actually disciplined again:\n\nPhase 1: Dopamine detox (the real kind)\n	‚Ä¢	Phone went grayscale. Insta and TikTok became boring overnight.\n	‚Ä¢	No social media before 12PM. Morning brain is sacred now.\n	‚Ä¢	Blocked Reddit + YouTube during work hours. Cold-turkey. It hurt, but it worked.\n	‚Ä¢	Made a ‚Äúdopamine menu‚Äù ‚Äî stuff that gives long-term joy: workouts, walking outside, journaling. When I get the itch to scroll, I pick one from the list.\n\nPhase 2: Mental bootcamp\n	‚Ä¢	Woke up and made my bed immediately ‚Äî it‚Äôs dumb but it flips a switch.\n	‚Ä¢	Cold showers every morning. Instant reset button.\n	‚Ä¢	10-minute ‚Äúmind dump‚Äù journaling every night. Stops the 2AM overthinking spiral.\n	‚Ä¢	Practiced just sitting in silence for 5 minutes. No music. No phone. No stimulus. Surprisingly hard ‚Äî and that‚Äôs why it works.\n\nPhase 3: Discipline by design\n	‚Ä¢	Created a ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù ritual at night ‚Äî lights off, screens off, book out. Brain starts winding down automatically now.\n	‚Ä¢	Broke my work into 90-minute blocks with real breaks. Way more sustainable than grinding nonstop.\n	‚Ä¢	Took the pressure off being ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù Missed a day? Whatever. Show up tomorrow.\n	‚Ä¢	Set 1 non-negotiable task per day. Do that, day‚Äôs a win. Bonus tasks = extra points.\n\nSmall habits that had big results:\n	‚Ä¢	Chew gum while working (weirdly helps me focus).\n	‚Ä¢	Switched coffee to matcha + L-theanine. No more jittery crashes.\n	‚Ä¢	Set up a time-locking box for my phone. Game changer.\n	‚Ä¢	Box breathing (4-4-4-4). Sounds cheesy. Works.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nI didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhack‚Äù my brain. I just stopped poisoning it 24/7 and gave it space to work. If you‚Äôre stuck, don‚Äôt overcomplicate it. Just start. Build a system that helps you show up even when you feel like crap.‚ú∫‚≠Ü['This post has a dusting of the book deep work by cal newport (I‚Äôm reading it now).

1ki3odn‚ú∫‚≠Ügamedev‚ú∫‚≠ÜI made 5k wishlists in my first Month on Steam, here is what i learned and how i turned sick!‚ú∫‚≠Ü# 1. Game Info / Steampage\n\n*(skip to next point if not interested)*\n\n**Name:** Fantasy World Manager\n\n**Developer:** Florian Alushaj Games\n\n**Publisher:**  Florian Alushaj Games\n\n**Steampage:** [**https://store.steampowered.com/app/3447280?utm\_source=postmortem1**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3447280?utm_source=postmortem1)\n\n**Discord:**  [https://discord.gg/vHCZQ3EJJ8](https://discord.gg/vHCZQ3EJJ8)\n\n**Current Wishlists:** 4,781\n\n# 2. Pre-Launch Actions\n\ni frequently got asked what i did on my Page Launch Day to bundle alot of traffic Day 1, here is what i did:\n\n**a) Discord Communities**\n\ni got Discord Premium, this allows me to join ALOT more Discord Servers in general. I have joined over 30 Gamedev related Discords that allow advertising. I have posted atleast weekly on each one of them since i started the project, which was in December 2024.\n\nYou should not underestimate the power of those Discord Communities. While it ultimately might not convert many wishlists or mostly "poor" ones which might never convert, you get to meet other devs that like what you do, that already have experience or that have similar games like you to partner up or help each other.\n\ni have met alot of people that work for small indie studios that have released several games on steam, they gave me alot of tips for my first game, the most frequent ones:\n\n* Do proper Market Research\n   * its really important to check similar games and how games in your genre perform (median)\n   * find out what games you could combine, what you could do better - you dont have to reinvent the wheel.\n   * dont try make the 9988th vampire survivors, dont make the 9988th stardew valley, those are exceptions and not the norm. instead learn from them, what is the hook?\n* **Connect with other Devs**\n   * as already stated, other devs can be really valueable contacts and i definitely can call some of my dev contacts friends at this point, your friends are very biased no matter what you show them but your dev friends will be very honest if you ask for feedback\n* **KEEP ASKING FOR FEEDBACK**\n   * dont stop asking for feedback where-ever you can! you may have fun with your project, playing it yourself, but you are biased! showcase new stuff, no matter if its just your first Draft - people on reddit and discord are really good at giving feedback for improvements.\n* **Do not quit your job**\n   * Dont..dont...dont!\n   * expect your first game to be a "failure" in terms of revenue\n   * use your first game as your deep dive in all aspects of gamedev (including promotion &  (paid) marketing\n* **LOCALIZATION**\n   * this is so important, please localize your steampage!!! you will see why later.\n\n**b) Reddit**\n\n**I have made around 30 posts between December and 6th April (Steam Page Launch)**\n\n**they gained 1.3 Million Views and 14.000 Upvotes, over 1.000 shares. My Creator Page got 70+ Followers, my Reddit Account got 60+ Followers.**\n\n50% of those posts were not selfpromotion, they were progress updates in the r/godot community (check my profile) but alot of people saw my game and kept it in mind, because i posted frequently, and people kept pushing my posts!\n\n**c) thats it...**\n\nyou may have expected way more, but thats everything i did pre-steam-page-launch. However, my Reddit posts were a sign that my game does really well on Reddit. - thats important for post-launch activities i did.\n\n# 3. Launch Day\n\n**Those are the things i did on Launch Day:**\n\na) i posted on ALL Discord Communites i am part of that i launched my Steampage and asked for support! If i sum the reactions i got up in all those communitys, i got over 200 Reactions, i didnt UTM track those unfortunately but it definitely had an Traffic Impact.\n\nb) i made reddit posts in some subreddits, those posts gained  around 120k views combined, 300 shares.also here i didnt know that utm tracklinks existed but from the steam stats i could tell alot of traffic was from reddit.\n\n**Tose are the the things that happened without me doing anything on Launch Day:**\n\na) 4gamer article + twitter post:\n\nthe japanese magacine 4gamer posted my game, they just picked it up organically - if it was not localized in japanese, they would never have found my steam page. Thanks to their article i gained 700 wishlists from japan in the first 24 hours.\n\nthis combined with my own effort made me around 1,100 wishlists in the first day.\n\n# 4.) What happened since then?\n\nI made another Reddit post in gamedev,indiedev,worldbuilding some days after, which made me another 700 wishlists. Then i started getting quiet, i didnt post anymore for almost a Month. My Organic wishlists were 100 for a few day, it went down to 30-40.  Without me doing anything i was gaining those daily wishlists.. which was and still is really crazy.\n\n# 5.) Paid Reddit Ads\n\nAfter i reached 2.100 wishlists (17th april) i was certain that my game is really being liked on reddit, it was time to take the advice from fellow devs i met and try out reddit ads and hell yeah, it was the best decision. Since 17th April i have been running ads, i have made atleast 1600 wishlists with a spent budget of 400‚Ç¨ , those are the UTM tracked wishlists, which is an investment of 0,26‚Ç¨ per wishlist.\n\nMy Ads are still running, and i will keep them running until the demo releases. If you advertise in the right Subreddits, you will find your audience! Those are not "poor" wishlists as many people rant about. Many Contacts told me publishers usually do a big bugdet reddit ad campaign until your game has 7k wishlists and then they stop.\n\nSo why not do the same strategy?\n\n**My tips:**\n\n**1. Go for Conversion in your AD Campaign**\n\n**2. it does not matter if you use Carousel,Video,Image, i prefer Carousel**\n\n**3. Only include countries you localize for**\n\n**4. US should be in its own campaign, set your CPC to 0.30 , it will perform well enough**\n\n**5. Leave your Comments on, reply to people. i ahve really good experience with that (60+ comments on my ads)**\n\n**6. Also bring in people to your discord, i crossed 100 people today, its really cool to have people that love your game,it boosts motivation so high and you got playtesters!**\n\n# 6. NUMBER SICKNESS! CAREFUL!\n\nThis is really crazy, but if your game performs well with numbers.. stop looking at your numbers.. dont do it! I did that and i did only that for atleast a week, doing nothing for the game - just starring at those raising numbers and when one day it dropped a bit, i felt some panic!  I felt like the game is gonna fail while still performing better tan 90% of indie projects (firsts).\n\ni am only checking numbers weekly since that happened to me.\n\nwell..thats it.. i hope it was interesting. feel free to ask more questions!‚ú∫‚≠Ü['Thats a great result especially with no trailer! You probably would have hit 20K with a trailer!', 'You sneaky you! I actually clicked on an ad earlier as it caught my eye!\nGood luck!', "What's the use of wishlists if they dont turn into buyers?\n\nOr this is expectation growth before actual launch?\n\nHmm how do you even price your game so it converts into a winner and not a break even situation (revenue = ad * effort spent)"]

1kja4zu‚ú∫‚≠ÜSaaS‚ú∫‚≠ÜStop making stupid SaaS and start solving real niche problems‚ú∫‚≠ÜIt's always SaaS Groundhog Day on this community...\n\nAnother post, another AI copywriting tool that requires a PhD to figure out. Or, I am being invited to the 12th Product Hunt clone that‚Äôs gone live this month.\n\nYou all are fighting for scraps in oversaturated markets while actual businesses with money are BEGGING for solutions to real problems.\n\nThe gold mine isn't in your generic tracker app, nobody will pay for. It's in those unsexy niches where companies are desperate enough to throw cash at anyone who understands their actual pain points.\n\nStop chasing the SaaS hype train and start solving problems people actually have. Your bank account will thank you.\n\nHere are ten ideas for niche SaaS products that one of you should start building today.\n\n# Regulated Industries\n\n* Idea: HIPAA-compliant messaging platform for small medical clinics.\n* Why it's smart: Healthcare providers require secure communication tools that comply with strict regulations. Offering a HIPAA-compliant messaging solution addresses this critical need, ensuring patient data privacy and facilitating efficient communication within clinics.\n\n# Niche B2B Vertical Tools\n\n* Idea: Scheduling and management software tailored for pet groomers.\n* Why it's smart: Generic scheduling tools often lack features specific to pet grooming businesses. A specialized platform can offer functionalities like pet profiles, vaccination tracking, and breed-specific grooming notes, directly catering to the unique needs of this niche market.\n\n# Internal Tools for Non-Tech Teams\n\n* Idea: Onboarding portals designed for HR departments.\n* Why it's smart: Human Resources teams frequently rely on outdated systems or spreadsheets for onboarding. A dedicated portal streamlines the process, ensuring consistency, compliance, and a better experience for new hires.\n\n# Data & Reporting Automation\n\n* Idea: Automated reporting tools that sync e-commerce analytics to spreadsheets.\n* Why it's smart: Manually compiling reports from platforms like Shopify is time-consuming and error-prone. Automating this process saves time, reduces mistakes, and provides real-time insights for better decision-making.\n\n# Boring Business Back-Office\n\n* Idea: Small chain store documentation management system.\n* Why it's smart: Small chain stores deal with extensive documentation, from training manuals to compliance forms. A centralized system ensures consistency across locations and simplifies updates, which is crucial for maintaining brand standards.\n\n# Event-Specific Tools\n\n* Idea: Management software for niche events like science fairs or hackathons.\n* Why it's smart: Such events have unique requirements, including participant registration, project submissions, and judging criteria. A tailored tool addresses these specific needs, enhancing the experience for organizers and participants.\n\n# Low-Code / No-Code Enablers\n\n* Idea: A workflow automation platform for specific industries, like legal or real estate.\n* Why it's smart: Professionals in these fields often lack technical expertise but need customized solutions. A low-code platform empowers them to build and modify workflows without coding, increasing efficiency and adaptability.\n\n# SaaS for Creators (Beyond Content Tools)\n\n* Idea: Income tracking and financial management tool for digital creators.\n* Why it's smart: Digital creators often juggle multiple income streams, making financial tracking complex. A dedicated tool simplifies income management, tax preparation, and financial planning, allowing artists to focus on their creative work.\n\n# Operations Software for Physical Businesses\n\n* Idea: Route planning and scheduling software for neighborhood service providers like pool cleaners.\n* Why it's smart: Mobile service businesses need efficient route planning to save time and fuel. A specialized tool optimizes schedules and routes, enhancing productivity and customer satisfaction.\n\n# APIs for Niche Data or Services\n\n* Idea: A sentiment analysis of local political campaigns, enabling real-time tracking of voter sentiment within specific districts or municipalities.\n* Why it works: Local campaigns often lack the resources for extensive polling or data analysis. This tool provides affordable, real-time insights into voter opinions by analyzing social media, local news, and community forums.\n\nNow, anyone who got this far, I know what you‚Äôre going to say. So I wrote an FAQ to address all the questions that the trolls will post in response.\n\n# FAQ\n\n# What if there are already competitors in the niche?\n\nGreat! Competitors validate market demand. Most niches aren't winner-take-all. Focus on specific pain points they're neglecting or target an underserved segment. Being second in a proven market often beats being first in an unproven one.\n\n# I tried XYZ idea before and it failed\n\nYes, new businesses do fail all the time. This isn't a surprise. But if you focus on a clear and obvious problem for a niche audience, you have a much better shot at success than building a SaaS tool with no obvious market. And be sure to validate your idea at each step.\n\n# I don't know anything about this industry. How can I build for it?\n\nInterview 5-10 potential customers. Join industry forums and attend trade shows. Consider partnering with someone who has domain expertise. The knowledge barrier actually protects you from generic competitors who won't put in the work.\n\n# How do I price a niche SaaS product?\n\nDon't underprice. Niche products often command premium rates because they solve specialized problems. Research what businesses currently spend on alternatives, then price based on value delivered, not just your costs. Many B2B niche products can justify $100 to $500+ monthly.\n\n# How do I find these niche opportunities?\n\nLook for industries still using spreadsheets or outdated software. Talk to friends in non-tech fields. Browse industry forums for recurring complaints. The best niches are hiding in plain sight, just invisible to founders fixated with posting on this community.\n\n# Won't these markets be too small?\n\nA focused $3M business serving a specific niche beats a failed unicorn attempt. Many niches are larger than they appear and can support multiple successful companies. Starting narrow doesn't mean staying narrow. You can always expand after establishing your foundation.\n\n# How do I market to these niche audiences?\n\nForget growth hacking. Go where your audience already gathers, like industry conferences, trade publications, and specialized communities. One industry influencer or respected customer case study often opens more doors than thousands spent on generic marketing.‚ú∫‚≠Ü['Thanks for the ideas ChatGPT.. and you of course are there to help the to-be-founders to market these ideas lol.', 'This is straight from Chagpt bro common.

1kipp0o‚ú∫‚≠ÜSoloDevelopment‚ú∫‚≠ÜCan you make a living as an indie dev without going viral?‚ú∫‚≠ÜI know it‚Äôs technically possible but I‚Äôm curious if there is anyone here that makes games full time without making a viral hit or having massive success.

If you\'re looking for a living, do non-game dev first. The market is way more forgiving on general software dev because it\'s less glamorous. \n\nBuild up to the fun stuff. And then do it for fun and love.']
1ki25n5‚ú∫‚≠ÜSideProject‚ú∫‚≠ÜReddit is a goldmine of startup ideas-and it blew my mind.‚ú∫‚≠ÜEvery day I‚Äôd see posts like: \n‚Ä¢	‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there a tool that does X?‚Äù \n‚Ä¢	‚ÄúThis app‚Äôs UX is awful, I wish someone would fix it.‚Äù \n‚Ä¢	‚ÄúDoes anyone know a service that solves Y?‚Äù\n\nAnd I kept thinking: These are literally startup-worthy signals. Just buried under layers of comments and chaos.\n\nSo I started building a tool that surfaces those signals-turning all that noise into a clean, usable feed of startup ideas.\n\nWe shared the early concept here a while ago and it got way more traction than we expected. That feedback helped us iterate fast-and now we‚Äôre at 100+ early signups.\n\nSome were bots or duplicates (filtered out with a quick fix), and we‚Äôre now building the MVP.\n\nStill figuring out: \n‚Ä¢	How to grow organically without triggering subreddit rules \n‚Ä¢	Which features truly help people spot valuable ideas \n‚Ä¢	And how to stay user-focused, not just feature-happy\n\nWould love to hear how others discovered their first 100 users-or what you‚Äôd want from a tool that turns Reddit noise into insight.‚ú∫‚≠Ü['I would not exactly call it a goldmine.

182okhk‚ú∫‚≠ÜEntrepreneur‚ú∫‚≠ÜHow I went from ~¬£2k per month to ~¬£45k per month in 5 months (Revenue) doing ecommerce (not dropshipping!) whilst working a full time job.‚ú∫‚≠ÜHey!\n\nLong time lurker and learner on this sub, inspired by all the many great stories I've come across. Often when I'm feeling least motivated I revist this sub and always leave feeling inspired - so I'm hoping this post can do the same for some people.\n\nNo, I'm not a millionaire, and yes, this could all come crashing down tomorrow, but I seem to have figured out something that works consistently - and most importantly - can scale.\n\nThere's quite an interesting backstory about how this business came around, but I'll share that another time if anyone is interested.\n\nSo, let me share you what I was doing to make around 2k per month, and not even breakeven.\n\nFirstly, I was selling exclusively on google ads, with a ROAS of around 1.7. I could only achieve this by selling our products at a razor thin margin, so I was actually losing a bit of money during this time. This went on for about 6 months, from January 23 until July 23. Throughout this time I'd dabbled with ads on Meta but nothing ever really took off - because I didn't understand the importance of creatives. An image of your product alone is rarely going to work.\n\nIn June, I tried a new method. I created a video showing off our best selling product. It was a simple video, but highlighted all of it's key features. It wasn't super professional, I mean I was literally on my bed with holding the product and showing it off becuase the bedsheet was the only semi-decent background I could find.\n\nAnyway, the day after I ran this video on Facebook and Instagram, I hit ¬£290 in a single day, with an AOV of ¬£72. The whole WEEK before this I only managed to do ¬£300 with an AOV of ¬£27\n\nI didn't change anything, and the next day, I did ¬£469 - my best ever day before this was ¬£300 but I was generally happy if we managed ¬£100 in a day, so this was mindboggling.\n\nThe next day - ¬£816!!! Each of these days I was only spending ¬£40 on ads, so to get back ¬£816 was truly amazing and more than double our previous best day by some margin! The best part was, we hit that figure by about 2pm, and then hit our facebook daily spend limit - otherwise who knows much we could've done in one day! For a few days the ROAS was around 10-15. Months later, I still sit around a 3-5 ROAS each month which is very profitable for us, and way better than the 1.7 we used to get via google.\n\nThis all started all in July 2023, and I managed to hit nearly 12k for the month. My previous best month was 3.8k - and I broke-even. Because this 12k was our best selling product that had a healthy margin, I netted about 4k that month.\n\nI fully sold out of stock in July, and had to wait a month for new stock. I was 'open' for only about 5 days in August - but still managed around 4.5k - my second best ever month.\n\nSince then, we've had continuous struggles with maintaining stock because the lead time is 60 days, and I simply haven't got the working capital to buy enough of the stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, here are the numbers by month since my new advertising strategy in July:\n\n\- July - ¬£11,937.10 - AOV 45.06\n\n\- August - ¬£4335.85 - AOV 44.18\n\n\- September - ¬£20,567.70 AOV - 46.76\n\n\- October - ¬£25,053.33 -  AOV ¬£47.40\n\n\- November (MTD 24th Nov) - ¬£35,557.62 - AOV 48.39\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're on track to do about 45k in November which to me is faily mindblowing! My goal is 100k revenue per month consistently which will be around 30k net per month. I come from a low-income background so this would be pure insanity to me.\n\nAll of this was only possible because of my advertising strategy on Meta. I watched countless videos and tried different things for MONTHS, but when I found what worked, I simply repeated the process and increased the daily budget. It's not complicated and I'm 100% confident you can do this too, you just need to find what works and then scale it.\n\nI'm confident I can continue to scale this because every time I increase the advertising budget, the revenue follows. We're simply bottle necked by stock levels. A pretty good problem to have if you ask me.\n\nAnyway, I hope this shares a little of what is possible. Our business isn't anything particularly new, it just uses a new advertising angle. If you want me to go into more detail on anything then I'll do my best to reply in the comments. For obvious reasons, I will not be sharing our products on website here.\n\nSales - [Sales YTD](https://imgur.com/a/bwyJODt)‚ú∫‚≠Ü['Nice write up! For it to be more beneficial to the readers here, would be nice to get some granular details.\n- Did you test multiple variations of the video you found working? Tried different hooks?\n- Are you starting to experience ad fatigue with that one video you scaled? Or are you scaling multiple videos simultaneously?\n- What prevented you from securing a loan or investment to fund inventory / prevent the fulfillment constraints?\n- Is the November sales increase partly due to a strategy shift or purely due to the typical Q4 increase in consumer spending? Does what you sell have an element of seasonality?\n- Do you run ads to a landing page / advertorial, or straight to a typical Shopify product detail page? Anything you‚Äôre doing to increase conversion rates?\n\nI think answering these specifics and ‚Äútalking shop‚Äù might be beneficial to everyone here and something concrete they could take away. Obviously non pressure to answer. - Simon', "Good job OP, seems like you're doing a great job.\n\nAs a marketer with years of experience on FB, my word of advice here is gonna be a cliche:\n\n*Don't put all your eggs in one basket, or, don't have you entire business at Meta's mercy*\n\nThe amount of business I've seen get fucked by facebook is unimaginable. One day you're on 5 ROAS, and the next they lock your account/disable your ads/make a change to the algo that gets your to 0.5 ROAS.\n\nMake sure you're following up with customers, do what you can to upsell them later on, give them discounts for referring friends.\n\nAnd make sure to try more platforms. If your vids worked on FB they can work on Youtube ads, Organic TikTok posts, Pinterest ads (if the niche fits).\n\nKeep up the good work!"]
